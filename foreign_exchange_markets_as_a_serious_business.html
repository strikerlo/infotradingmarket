                        <h3>Is Foreign Exchange Market (FOREX) Reliable?</h3>
                        <p>Forex trading must be seen as a serious business, not just a casual roll of the dice
                            or a leisurely pursuit. If you approach trading as a means of getting your dose of
                            adrenaline, do yourself a favour by staying away from it – you will do less harm to
                            your pockets by going to the latest Louis Vuitton sale or by bidding on that vintage
                            car on eBay for the adrenaline shot.
                        </p>

                        <p>Serious money demands serious work. Winners from the trading arena take a nononsense
                            approach to trading – they take care of their P&L (profits and losses),
                            enter only into high probability trades and keep meticulous record of all their
                            trades.
                        </p>
                        <p>Both serious and casual traders, of course, dream of making it big in the forex
                            market, but it is not the goal that counts, it is the preparation and dedication that is
                            important. Forex trading should be considered and treated as a serious business, just
                            like other types of businesses. Approaching trading from the perspective of a
                            shrewd business person can greatly tilt your chances of success to your side.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Middle of the night mobile trading</h3>
                        <p>An alarm from my computer rings. Jolted from sleep, I drag my feet – with eyes
                            half-open – into my trading room. I turn on the LCD monitors and look
                            immediately at the screen showing the 5-minute chart of GBP/USD. The time is
                            2:10am and the FOMC minutes have just been released. GBP/USD has fallen by
                            around 40 pips so far to 1.9730 – an intraday low.
                        </p>
                        <p>I click on the headline which summarises what the minutes say. It seems that the
                            Fed’s main concern is that inflation will fail to moderate as expected, and that
                            future policy adjustments will depend on incoming economic data. This statement
                            is very similar to the previous one; hence there is not much reaction in the forex
                            market. Both EUR/USD and USD/CHF barely move more than 20 pips. I wait a
                            few more minutes to see how the price action in GBP/USD will unfold, but when
                            I see that the currency pair is losing momentum, I switch off the monitors and go
                            back to bed. The price is not where I want to buy GBP/USD.
                        </p>

                        <p>Too soon, morning comes. I start off the day by having breakfast in front of one of
                            my computers, looking at screens that show the 5-minute charts USD/CHF,
                            EUR/USD, USD/JPY and GBP/USD. These four currency pairs (also known as
                            “majors”) are what I usually check out the first thing in the morning, unless I’ve
                            got a position open in other currency pairs. I quickly scroll through the news
                            headlines that are displayed in the news feeds, and select those which relate directly
                            to forex. Sometimes there are tons of press reports to read, other times there isn’t
                            much, and today there is a sprinkle of reports written by financial news journalists
                            who are all trying to dissect what the Fed is up to.
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The analysis that I had done yesterday threw up some significant support and
                            resistance levels in USD/CHF, and since I’m not expecting any big price breakouts
                            in the meantime, I place some limit orders near them. As much as I am eager for
                            some fast-moving actions in the market, most currency pairs still haven’t moved
                            much during the time I was asleep, since the release of FOMC minutes several
                            hours ago. The market seems pretty boring at this time.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The lull in market activity gives me some time to note down, and
                            to work on some trading articles.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Lunch Time Mobile Trading</h3>
                        <p>Later on, just as I am getting ready to go out for lunch with a friend, I see that
                            USD/CHF is moving up toward a specific resistance level, and my short position
                            (to sell-short instead of buying) could be open very soon. To make sure the trade is
                            still sound, I quickly check the news feeds to see if any news or rumours might have
                            triggered this move.
                        </p>

                            <p>As it moves closer to my price point, I decide to leave the short order in place as
                                the move doesn’t seem to be triggered by any news. The market is moving up and
                                closer to my position; it is now only one pip away. I make sure all my charts are up,
                                and I prepare to monitor this trade. Suddenly, USD/CHF seems to move down. I
                                wonder if I’ve missed the opportunity. It is now 12 pips away from my opening
                                price, a bit too late for me to get in.</p>
                            <p>And just as suddenly as the price has gone down, it is now moving up again and
                                my order is now filled. It seems I haven’t missed out on the move after all. Now
                                my only fear is that USD/CHF could break out successfully from that resistance
                                point. The pair keeps moving up, 5 pips then 10. I am now in loss, but I’m not too

                                <h3>Non-Lunch Mobile Trading</h3>
                                <p>The up move on USD/CHF seems to be slowing down a bit. I guess others must be
                                    going short too. After what seems like an eternity, but is probably no more than five
                                    minutes, my position is back at break-even, which means I have neither made nor
                                    lost money at this point. This bounce trade seems to be taking a while, so I call my
                                    friend to let her know we will have to postpone our lunch meeting. Lunch will have
                                    to arrive in the form of junk food from my favorite food delivery outlet. Sometimes
                                    I watch my open trade like a hawk; other times, I simply continue with other
                                    activities.</p>
                                    <p>I set some price alarms and get back to writing my manuscript while waiting for my
                                        lunch. After all, it is usually better to do something else while waiting on the
                                        market. That way, a trader won’t feel as bored and it prevents him or her from
                                        trading out of boredom.</p>
                                    <p>After lunch, the alarms ring. I look at the charts and see that USD/CHF is moving
                                        down sharply. Looks like I am close to reaching my profit target. Institutional
                                        traders must be back from lunch and are taking profits on their long positions.
                                        Finally, to my delight, within the next half hour, my short USD/CHF trade reaches
                                        the profit objective.</p>
                                        <h3>End of the Day Mobile Trading</h3>
                                        <p>With this trade out of the way, I look for upcoming trading opportunities. They are
                                            all quite far from the current price, so I embark on the regular routine of blogging
                                            on my website about the latest developments in the market and their implications,
                                            and capture some chart screenshots to include in the post. Trading blogs, especially
                                            those that have fresh and relevant material, can be a valuable source of useful and
                                            targeted information for busy traders who hold day jobs. This blogging habit, which
                                            constitutes part of my market homework, has helped me in my own trading. I also
                                            take the time to interact with the online community of traders by participating in
                                            forums such as that as <a href="www.forexvibes.com">ForexVibes.</a></p>
                                        <p>Trading is unlike a 9-to-5 job; there isn’t a fixed time for the start or the end of my
                                            daily trading activities. This means that sometimes I will end past midnight, and
                                            other times I will be done well before lunch time.
                                        </p>

                                        <p id="indent">There are some important differences between investing and trading, even though
                                            some people may use these terms interchangeably without giving it much thought
                                            of what each entails. Advantages can be found in both ways of growing your
                                            money, neither is better than the other – they have different roles.</p>
                                        <p id="indent">But when it comes to growing your wealth in the forex market, trading is usually
                                            the way to go due to the unique aspects of this market.</p>
                                        <h3>VALUE OWNERSHIP</h3>
                                        <p id="indent">Investors are concerned with acquiring the ownership of the financial instrument;
                                            they have the confidence that the instrument will continue to rise in value. They
                                            tend to “buy low and sell high”. For example, when they see that the stock price is
                                            going down, they may see it as a good opportunity to buy and own the stock
                                            ‘cheaply’ so that they may profit when the stock goes back higher in the future.</p>
                                        <p id="indent">Traders, on the other hand, do not have much concern with the buying and owning
                                            of the instrument. They exhibit the same ease with either longing (buying) or shortselling
                                            the instrument. Unlike investors, traders are more willing to buy ‘high’ in
                                            the hope of being able to sell even ‘higher’, or short-sell ‘low’ in the hope of being
                                            able to buy back later at an even ‘lower’ price.</p>

                                            <h3>TIME FRAME</h3>
                                        <P id="indent">Investing usually entails the “buy and hold” concept, whereby an investor’s goal is
                                            to acquire a financial instrument and to hold it for medium to long term, in the hope
                                            that the instrument will rise in significant value after a certain period of time.
                                            Trading couldn’t be any more different. In trading, a trader’s main goal is to profit
                                            whichever way the market goes, whether upward or downward, within a shorter
                                            time frame. While there is short and long term trading, the holding period rarely
                                            extends beyond more than a few months, or longer than a year.</P>
                                        <h3>GETTING IN</h3>
                                        <p id="indent">Serious investors tend to buy an instrument based on the underlying fundamental
                                            reasons. For instance, savvy stock investors will analyze the background of a
                                            company, pour over its quarterly earnings report, assess the company’s reputation
                                            and strength in the particular industry sector, and assess the potential of its products
                                            and the track record of the management team. Traders, however, tend to look for
                                            high-probability trade setups using technical analysis as their favourite tool, and
                                            many of them also incorporate market sentiment into their trading decisions. Short-term traders are quick to recognise changing market trends, and take advantage of
                                            price swings in the market, whether in range-bound or trending environments.</p>
                                        <h3>GETTING OUT</h3>
                                        <P id="indent">The “buy and hold” mentality of investors tends not to deviate far from “buy and
                                            forget”, as many investors almost have zilch idea of when to get out of their
                                            investment when things do not go well. Many stock investors are left with
                                            worthless stocks as they do not have stop-loss boundaries or know when to cut their
                                            losses. While there are also many traders out there who do not have risk
                                            management rules in place, traders overall are generally more aware of proper risk
                                            management than most investors. Whether or not they translate these rules into
                                            practice is another thing altogether.</P>

                                        <p id="indent">Before you enter into a position, you need to know – beforehand – when you are
                                            going to exit the market. A trader is not going to hold onto a position indefinitely,
                                            that’s for sure. Knowing the time frame of how long you wish to hold onto your
                                            open position will determine your exit points and prices. If you choose to hold a
                                            position for, say, a week, your profit objective would naturally be higher than if you
                                            were to hold it for a few hours because you would expect the price to move further,
                                            given the longer period of time.</p>
                                        <p id="indent">This is a personal decision which has to be made by the trader, depending on his or
                                            her risk tolerance level, lifestyle desired, and the amount of time to be dedicated to

                                        <h3><a id="scalping"></a> SCALPING</h3>
                                        <p>This is the shortest time frame in trading; it exploits small changes in currency
                                            prices. It describes the ultra-rapid action of opening and closing of a position within
                                            a few seconds or minutes, with the aim of stealing a few pips from each trade. The
                                            profit of the winning trade is small, while the number of such winning trades should
                                            be big enough so that these small profits can add up to a decent amount.</p>
                                        <p>Scalpers usually need to have access to the tightest spreads and fastest connection
                                            speeds possible, in order to carry out this bullet-speed trading with the tiny profits.
                                            They tend to do this many times a day so as to accumulate the little profits that are
                                            harvested.</p>
                                        <p>Losses must be limited such that one large loss does not wipe out the profits gained
                                            from many winning trades.</p>
                                        <p>Many forex market makers discourage this type of trading as they find it difficult
                                            to cover the opposite side of the transactions, given the fast speed and numerous
                                            orders entered into their systems.</p>
                                        <h3> <a id="day"></a>DAY TRADING</h3>
                                        <p>Day trading is one of the more popular types of trading, whereby traders open and
                                            close positions within a day. They also do not hold their positions overnight
                                            because of the added risk of not knowing if prices would change dramatically while
                                            they sleep. The holding period of their trades may range from minutes to hours.</p>
                                        <p>Day trading relies heavily on intraday momentum to bring the current price to the
                                            desired price level in one direction. Day traders are looking out for signs that a
                                            currency pair has a high probability of moving in a particular direction, going from
                                            point X to point Y, within a day regardless of whether the price is moving in a trend
                                            or range.</p>
                                        <p>Day traders tend to wait for good trading opportunities, instead of trading
                                            frantically like scalpers tend to do. This style of trading involves intense
                                            concentration from the trader as positions must be closely monitored on the price
                                            charts.</p>

                                        <p>Swing traders hold their positions for a few days, but seldom more than a week.
                                            Identifying and riding on trends early is the central objective of this trading style,
                                            and the profit objective tends to be set higher than that of day trading since the
                                            swing trader is expecting that by holding out for a few days, there is a better chance
                                            of capturing a larger price move. Unlike the day trader, the swing trader has to
                                            endure overnight risk.</p>
                                        <p>As swing trading requires much less minute-to-minute monitoring of the market,
                                            this type of trading is generally preferred by people who hold day jobs.</p>
                                        <p>My opinion is that swing traders must still keep up-to-date with the latest
                                            fundamental and technical changes in the market, even when they are not
                                            monitoring the market all the time.</p>
                                        <h3><a id="position"></a> POSITION TRADING</h3>
                                        <P>Position trading spans the longest period of time, and refers to traders holding their
                                            position for weeks or even months. Position traders seek to identify and trade
                                            currency pairs that signal that a medium to long term trend is playing out – but will
                                            take more than a few days to play out. Their positions are usually closed before the
                                            trend runs out of power. This trading time frame is the least time-consuming one
                                            among all the different ones, as there is not much need for intensive monitoring.
                                            Many position traders place a trailing stop which automatically closes their position
                                            if the price retraces past a particular point.</P>

                                        <p>Someone who day trades tends to be more in touch with the price swings and
                                            goings-on of the market as positions are opened and closed during the same day.
                                            Whereas at the end of the spectrum, a position trader does not have to monitor the
                                            market so intensively.</p>
                                        <p>Risk-wise, I would say that the longer the time frame used in trading, the more risk
                                            has to be assumed by the trader. This is simply because the market has more time
                                            to move against them, and can move much further against them than it can in a
                                            smaller time frame.</p>
                                        <p>Many of the strategies mentioned in this book are meant for short-term trading.
                                            However, you may decide on the length of your holding period to suit your personal
                                            preference by adjusting the profit target and stop-loss accordingly. Of course, the
                                            size of profit objective and stop-loss will be proportional to the length of your
                                            holding period – the shorter your time frame, the smaller your profit target and
                                            stop-loss should be; the longer the trading time frame, the wider your profit target
                                            and stop-loss can be.
