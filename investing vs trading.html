        <h2>INVESTING VS TRADING IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET</h2>
        <p id="indent">There are some important differences between investing and trading, even though
            some people may use these terms interchangeably without giving it much thought
            of what each entails. Advantages can be found in both ways of growing your
            money, neither is better than the other – they have different roles.</p>
        <p id="indent">But when it comes to growing your wealth in the forex market, trading is usually
            the way to go due to the unique aspects of this market.</p>
        <h3>VALUE OWNERSHIP</h3>
        <p id="indent">Investors are concerned with acquiring the ownership of the financial instrument;
            they have the confidence that the instrument will continue to rise in value. They
            tend to “buy low and sell high”. For example, when they see that the stock price is
            going down, they may see it as a good opportunity to buy and own the stock
            ‘cheaply’ so that they may profit when the stock goes back higher in the future.</p>
        <p id="indent">Traders, on the other hand, do not have much concern with the buying and owning
            of the instrument. They exhibit the same ease with either longing (buying) or shortselling
            the instrument. Unlike investors, traders are more willing to buy ‘high’ in
            the hope of being able to sell even ‘higher’, or short-sell ‘low’ in the hope of being
            able to buy back later at an even ‘lower’ price.</p>
        <h3>TIME FRAME</h3>
        <P id="indent">Investing usually entails the “buy and hold” concept, whereby an investor’s goal is
            to acquire a financial instrument and to hold it for medium to long term, in the hope
            that the instrument will rise in significant value after a certain period of time.
            Trading couldn’t be any more different. In trading, a trader’s main goal is to profit
            whichever way the market goes, whether upward or downward, within a shorter
            time frame. While there is short and long term trading, the holding period rarely
            extends beyond more than a few months, or longer than a year.</P>
        <h3>GETTING IN</h3>
        <p id="indent">Serious investors tend to buy an instrument based on the underlying fundamental
            reasons. For instance, savvy stock investors will analyze the background of a
            company, pour over its quarterly earnings report, assess the company’s reputation
            and strength in the particular industry sector, and assess the potential of its products
            and the track record of the management team. Traders, however, tend to look for
            high-probability trade setups using technical analysis as their favourite tool, and
            many of them also incorporate market sentiment into their trading decisions. Short-term traders are quick to recognise changing market trends, and take advantage of
            price swings in the market, whether in range-bound or trending environments.</p>
        <h3>GETTING OUT</h3>
        <P id="indent">The “buy and hold” mentality of investors tends not to deviate far from “buy and
            forget”, as many investors almost have zilch idea of when to get out of their
            investment when things do not go well. Many stock investors are left with
            worthless stocks as they do not have stop-loss boundaries or know when to cut their
            losses. While there are also many traders out there who do not have risk
            management rules in place, traders overall are generally more aware of proper risk
            management than most investors. Whether or not they translate these rules into
            practice is another thing altogether.</P>
        <hr><h3>TRADING TIME FRAME</h3>
        <p id="indent">Before you enter into a position, you need to know – beforehand – when you are
            going to exit the market. A trader is not going to hold onto a position indefinitely,
            that’s for sure. Knowing the time frame of how long you wish to hold onto your
            open position will determine your exit points and prices. If you choose to hold a
            position for, say, a week, your profit objective would naturally be higher than if you
            were to hold it for a few hours because you would expect the price to move further,
            given the longer period of time.</p>
        <p id="indent">This is a personal decision which has to be made by the trader, depending on his or
            her risk tolerance level, lifestyle desired, and the amount of time to be dedicated to
            analyzing the market.</p>
        <h2>There are mainly four different types of trading time frames:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#scalping"> SCALPING</a></li>
            <li><a href="#day"> DAY TRADING </a></li>
            <li><a href="#swing">SWING TRADING </a></li>
            <li><a href="#position">POSITION TRADING</a></li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3><a id="scalping"></a> SCALPING</h3>
        <p id="indent">This is the shortest time frame in trading; it exploits small changes in currency
            prices. It describes the ultra-rapid action of opening and closing of a position within
            a few seconds or minutes, with the aim of stealing a few pips from each trade. The
            profit of the winning trade is small, while the number of such winning trades should
            be big enough so that these small profits can add up to a decent amount.</p>
        <p id="indent">Scalpers usually need to have access to the tightest spreads and fastest connection
            speeds possible, in order to carry out this bullet-speed trading with the tiny profits.
            They tend to do this many times a day so as to accumulate the little profits that are
            harvested.</p>
        <p id="indent">Losses must be limited such that one large loss does not wipe out the profits gained
            from many winning trades.</p>
        <p id="indent">Many forex market makers discourage this type of trading as they find it difficult
            to cover the opposite side of the transactions, given the fast speed and numerous
            orders entered into their systems.</p>
        <h3> <a id="day"></a>DAY TRADING</h3>
        <p id="indent">Day trading is one of the more popular types of trading, whereby traders open and
            close positions within a day. They also do not hold their positions overnight
            because of the added risk of not knowing if prices would change dramatically while
            they sleep. The holding period of their trades may range from minutes to hours.</p>
        <p id="indent">Day trading relies heavily on intraday momentum to bring the current price to the
            desired price level in one direction. Day traders are looking out for signs that a
            currency pair has a high probability of moving in a particular direction, going from
            point X to point Y, within a day regardless of whether the price is moving in a trend
            or range.</p>
        <p id="indent">Day traders tend to wait for good trading opportunities, instead of trading
            frantically like scalpers tend to do. This style of trading involves intense
            concentration from the trader as positions must be closely monitored on the price
            charts.</p>
        <h3><a id="swing"></a> SWING TRADING</h3>
        <p id="indent">Swing traders hold their positions for a few days, but seldom more than a week.
            Identifying and riding on trends early is the central objective of this trading style,
            and the profit objective tends to be set higher than that of day trading since the
            swing trader is expecting that by holding out for a few days, there is a better chance
            of capturing a larger price move. Unlike the day trader, the swing trader has to
            endure overnight risk.</p>
        <p id="indent">As swing trading requires much less minute-to-minute monitoring of the market,
            this type of trading is generally preferred by people who hold day jobs.</p>
        <p id="indent">My opinion is that swing traders must still keep up-to-date with the latest
            fundamental and technical changes in the market, even when they are not
            monitoring the market all the time.</p>
        <h3><a id="position"></a> POSITION TRADING</h3>
        <P id="indent">Position trading spans the longest period of time, and refers to traders holding their
            position for weeks or even months. Position traders seek to identify and trade
            currency pairs that signal that a medium to long term trend is playing out – but will
            take more than a few days to play out. Their positions are usually closed before the
            trend runs out of power. This trading time frame is the least time-consuming one
            among all the different ones, as there is not much need for intensive monitoring.
            Many position traders place a trailing stop which automatically closes their position
            if the price retraces past a particular point.</P>
        <hr><h2>CHOOSING A TIME FRAME</h2>
        <p id="indent">As a general rule of thumb: the smaller the time frame you trade then the more time
            is needed to be devoted to monitoring the markets.</p>
        <p id="indent">Someone who day trades tends to be more in touch with the price swings and
            goings-on of the market as positions are opened and closed during the same day.
            Whereas at the end of the spectrum, a position trader does not have to monitor the
            market so intensively.</p>
        <p id="indent">Risk-wise, I would say that the longer the time frame used in trading, the more risk
            has to be assumed by the trader. This is simply because the market has more time
            to move against them, and can move much further against them than it can in a
            smaller time frame.</p>
        <p id="indent">Many of the strategies mentioned in this book are meant for short-term trading.
            However, you may decide on the length of your holding period to suit your personal
            preference by adjusting the profit target and stop-loss accordingly. Of course, the
            size of profit objective and stop-loss will be proportional to the length of your
            holding period – the shorter your time frame, the smaller your profit target and
            stop-loss should be; the longer the trading time frame, the wider your profit target
            and stop-loss can be.</p>
        <hr><h3>TEN RULES FOR TRADING IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET</h3>
        <p id="indent">I list here ten rules that I think are important for trading forex. I have split the list
            into five Dos and five Don’ts.</p>
        <h3>DOS RULES</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>When trying out a new trading strategy, always test it in a demo account, or with
                a small amount of money, before you commit more money to it.</li>
            <li>Always keep a record of each of your trades, with details of: why you got in,
                how you got out and why it turned out the way it did.</li>
            <li>Have a personalised trading plan and update it as you learn from the market.</li>
            <li>If you are unsure of a trade, stay out. It is better to miss an opportunity than to
                have a loss.</li>
            <li>When trading, keep up-to-date with both the fundamentals and technicals
                affecting the market. A trader in the dark is a trader in the red.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>DON'TS RULES</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Don’t trade with money you can’t afford to lose! It will affect you emotionally,
                and you will most likely lose it to irrational trading.</li>
            <li>Don’t follow someone else’s trading advice blindly. Always know why you are
                getting into a trade, and how you are going to get out of it.</li>
            <li>Don’t be concerned about being right. Just be concerned about being profitable.</li>
            <li>Don’t over-leverage. Chances are that your account will be decimated before
                you can recoup your losses and go into profit.</li>
            <li>Don’t revenge-trade the market. Vent your frustrations elsewhere after a loss.</li>
        </ol>
