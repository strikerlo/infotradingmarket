                        <h2>Decreased Volatility Breakout</h2>
                        <p>Trading breakouts is undeniably one of the most popular ways of profiting from the
                            forex market, and an earlier chapter has been devoted to the Breakout Trading
                            Strategy. In this chapter, I will discuss one of my favourite subsets of breakout
                            trading – the Decreased Volatility Breakout. While this strategy is similar to the
                            strategy of trading breakouts, it is specific to a certain condition in the forex market.
                        </p>
                        <p>Pull up any currency price chart and you will notice that currency movements can
                            be quite volatile as they often fluctuate even in the midst of a trending phase,
                            rallying at one moment and declining the next, or vice versa.
                        </p>
                        <p>Volatility is a measure of the scale of price fluctuations over time. Volatility tends
                            to be high when prices change to a large extent within a short period of time. The
                            reverse is true – volatility tends to be low when prices oscillate more or less close
                            to a certain price level, without deviating much in a short period of time.
                            It is indeed the volatile nature of the forex market that draws risk-seeking traders
                            and investors to it in search of high profits, for prices have to move by a decent
                            amount in order for profits to be reaped. However, entering the market when prices
                            are experiencing high volatility can be bad for your health – as you face the stress
                            and worry of whether the trade will go your way as prices move up and
                            down sharply.
                        </p>

                        <p>Even though currency prices seem to move in a very haphazard way, there are
                            several technical indicators which can help you visualise the volatility of currency
                            prices. I will show you two indicators–

                            which you can use to gauge the volatility of currency prices.

                            <h3><a id="moving"></a> Moving average</h3>
                            <p>A moving average is a simple but very handy indicator to add to your price charts
                                to indicate volatility as well as determining the underlying trend. A moving average
                                attempts to smooth and minimise “noisy data”. There are several variations of
                                moving averages: simple, exponential and weighted.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Simple moving average (SMA)</h1>
                            <p>A simple moving average is calculated by adding together the closing prices of a
                                currency pair over certain period of time, and then dividing the total by the number
                                of data points involved. For example, a 20-period simple moving average of say,
                                the EUR/USD, on a daily chart would be calculated by adding the closing prices of
                                the past 20 days and dividing the sum total by 20.
                                What makes this average “move” is that as new data comes in, it is incorporated
                                into the calculation of the sum total, while the oldest data, which is the first period
                                of the calculation, is dropped from it. In that way, the average changes and adapts
                                to each new period of data even though it is still calculated based on the same
                                number of periods.
                            </p>
                            <img src="sma.png" width="100%" height="390pt" alt="simple moving average illustration">
                            <p style="border: 2px black solid; border-radius:15px; text-align:center; box-shadow:dimgray; background: rgb(211, 216, 219); ">There are two different simple moving averages on this daily chart of
                                EUR/USD. Notice how the 100-day SMA tends to be further away from the
                                current price compared to the 20-day SMA. This is because with the 100-day
                                SMA, the closing prices of the last 100 periods are added up and then
                                divided by 100.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Exponential moving average (EMA)</h1>
                            <p>An exponential moving average puts more emphasis on more recent data and less
                                weight on old data in the calculation of the moving average, and is thus perceived
                                by many traders to be more relevant to the current situation. <br>
                                This is the formula for the exponential moving average:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <i>EMA = EMAp + {K * (Price - EMAp)} <br>
                                    where,<br>
                                    EMA = exponential moving average<br>
                                    EMAp = the previous period exponential moving average<br>
                                    K = smoothing constant<br>
                                    Price = current price<br>
                                    K, the smoothing constant, is derived from the time period<br>
                                    selected by the individual according to the formula below:<br>
                                    K = 2/n+1, where n is the period selected.<br>
                                    The smoothing constant, K, refers to the percentage of<br>
                                    weighting on the current value to be used.</i>
                            </p>
                            <img src="image/ema vs sma.png" width="100%" height="390pt" alt="simple moving average vs exponential moving average illustration">

                                has a faster reaction to price changes than the simple moving average, as the
                                EMA places a higher weighting on recent data than on older data.
                            </p>
                            <p>As the moving average is a lagging indicator, it will react only after prices have
                                moved. When it slopes up, it indicates that prices have been rising, and that the
                                trend is up. The reverse is true; when a moving average slopes downward, it
                                indicates weakness of the currency pair, and that the trend is down. When a moving
                                average is moving sideways, we can deduce that prices are also moving sideways
                                in a period of consolidation (see image below). Since prices tend to be more volatile
                                while they are moving up or down, you will see that the moving average will move
                                more wildly when tracking highly volatile price actions.
                                Decreased volatility is detected when a moving average moves sideways, and looks
                                like a smooth horizontal line. This indicates that the currency pair has settled into
                                a consolidation phase, and the trend has been interrupted, whether temporarily or
                                permanently.

                                average (EMA) trailing the currency prices. As prices rallied in an uptrend,
                                the EMA sloped upward till the point where it began to move sideways as
                                EUR/USD shifted from high to low volatility into a period of consolidation.
                                Later, as prices declined, the EMA sloped downward accordingly.

                            <p>Regardless of whether you use an exponential or simple moving average, you will
                                find it an interesting indicator of price volatility as it smoothes the numerous price
                                fluctuations into a more visibly pleasing format, which tells you at a quick glance
                                the volatility picture of the currency pair.
                                One thing to note is that as a lagging indicator, the moving average, however, may
                                not be a very timely volatility gauge, and may still be sloping upward or downward
                                even when prices are already showing decreased volatility and are moving
                                sideways.

                            <p>Another technical tool that traders can use to measure volatility of a currency pair
                                is the Bollinger bands. According to default settings found in most charting
                                software, the Bollinger bands are two lines which are plotted two standard deviations of a 20-period time horizon above and below a moving average. The
                                upper band represents +2 standard deviations, the lower band -2 standard
                                deviations, and the centre line is a 20-period simple moving average.
                            </p>
                            <p>You may notice from the diagram below that as USD/JPY becomes more volatile, the bands
                                increase in width, and when the pair becomes less volatile, the band width becomes
                                narrower as both the upper and lower bands converge towards the centre line. This
                                relationship between the band width and price volatility stems from the fact that
                                standard deviation measures volatility. Increased volatility is represented by a
                                widening band width, whereas decreased volatility is represented by a narrowing
                                band width.
