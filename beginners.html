    <h2>MEANING OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING (FOREX TRADING)</h2>
    <p id="indent">Forex (or FX) refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market">foreign exchange markets</a>, where currencies are traded.
        It is the biggest and fastest growing financial market in the world, with an average
        daily turnover of almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_spot">$2 trillion</a> – many times the total traded volume of the US
        stock exchanges.</p>
            
        <p id="indent">The forex market consists of a worldwide wired network of buyers and sellers of
            currencies, with trading all done <a href="">over-the-counter (OTC)</a>, which means that there
            is no central exchange and clearinghouse where orders are matched. If you are
            looking for 24-hour action, you can find it in this global trading system, where no
            physical barriers exist and activity moves seamlessly from one major financial
            centre to another.</p>
        <p id="indent">A reason why there is a veil of mystery over forex is that the market was once the
            exclusive playground of banks, hedge funds, corporations and financial institutions,
            where money changed hands for commercial and speculative purposes. However,
            forex has now expanded and is easily accessible to all traders with the rapid
            emergence of online <a href="https://www.avatrade.com/trading-account?tag=182095">currency trading platforms</a>. Many of these <a href="https://www.avatrade.com/trading-account?tag=182095">platforms</a> are wellequipped
            with free charting software, real-time news-feeds and easy-to-use order
            placing systems.</p>
            <script class="avaJavaCode" type="text/javascript">
                (function () {
                const url = "https://tracking.avapartner.com/impression/?affid=182095&html5Id=32942&adTheme=504&campaign=186549&campaignName=Default%20Campaign&tag=182095";
                if (!window.aSC) window.aSC = 0;
                window.aSC += 1;
                const cIX = window.aSC - 1;

        <p id="indent">The wide availability of sophisticated technology has spawned a whole new level
            of foreign exchange, where self-directed (so-called “retail”) traders can easily buy
            and sell currencies through an internet connection with a click of the mouse,
            dealing with invisible counter-parties on the other side of the transaction. This
            group of people (also known as speculative traders) engage in trading forex for the
            sole purpose of making profits.</p>
            <a href="https://www.avatrade.com/trading-account2?tag=182095" id="click">
                <p>Welcome to the new world of online forex trading.</p>
            </a>
        <p id="indent">The rapid fluctuations of currency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate">exchange rates</a> are what attract speculators to the
            forex market as currencies are highly sensitive, and thus react very fast to changing
            economic conditions of countries or regions, changing interest rates and political
            happenings around the world. Sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank">central banks</a> of countries attempt to
            intervene in the forex market if the policy-makers feel that their country’s currency
            is too strong or too weak for their own good. All these factors lead to high volatility
            of currency prices, which can be taken advantage of by traders who speculate on
            the direction and magnitude of the current and future price move.</p>
        <p id="indent">I would like to point out that while movements in certain currency pairs can be
            quite volatile in nature, most major currencies generally move less than 1% daily,
            which is much lower than that of active stocks, which can easily move between 5-
            10% per day. For a rough guide of currency pairs and their relative volatility, refer
            to Figure 1.1 under “Warming Up” in the later part of this chapter.</p>
        <p id="indent">Forex has increasingly become an extremely attractive alternative asset group for
            speculators to trade, in addition to the usual staple of stocks and futures. Anyone can trade forex, but not every one can be profitable. That’s the rule of any
            game – not every one can win.</p>
