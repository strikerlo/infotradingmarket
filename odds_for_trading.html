                        <h2>What Are the Odds of Scoring a Winning Trade?</h2>
                        <p>When many of us think of probabilities, the first thought that comes to mind is a coin toss—having a 50% chance of being correct on a given toss. Can something as simple as a coin toss be applied to investing in financial markets?
                            Probabilities, as with a coin toss, can indeed provide us with tools for approaching the markets, and the ideas can be applied in more ways than one might expect. For example, a trader's view on probability might be completely incorrect, and that might be the very reason why they are not making money in the markets. This article aims to help by providing an introduction to the probabilities of trading and statistics.

                        <h3>Understanding the Coin Toss</h3>
                        <p>Let's assume that at a given moment in time, a stock could just as easily move up as it could move down (even in a range, stocks move up and down). Thus, our probability of making a profit on a (short or long) position is 50%, which is the same as a coin flip.
                            Although most investors would not likely initiate random short-term trades, we will start with this scenario. If we have an equal probability of making a quick profit, does a run of profits or losses signal what future outcomes will be? No! Not on random trades. Each result still has a 50% probability, no matter what outcomes came prior. The same is true of a coin toss—if it lands heads ten consecutive times, the probability of it landing on tails on the next toss is still 50%.
                            A consecutive streak or a run can happen in random 50/50 events. A run refers to a number of identical outcomes that occur in a row. Here is a table displaying the probabilities of such a run; in other words, the odds of flipping a given number of heads or tails in a row.

                                <p>Here is where we run into problems. Let's say we have just made five profitable trades in a row. According to our table, which is giving us the probability of being right (or wrong) five times in a row based on a 50% chance, we have already overcome some serious odds. The odds of getting the sixth profitable trade look extremely remote, but actually, that is not the case. Our odds of success are still 50%.</p>
                                <p>People lose thousands of dollars in the financial markets (and in casinos) by failing to realize the randomness of probabilities. The odds from our coin-toss table are based on uncertain future events and the likelihood they will occur. Once we have completed a run of five successful trades, those trades are no longer uncertain. Our next trade starts a new potential run, and after the results are in for each trade, we start back at the top of the table, every single time. This means every trade has a 50% chance of working out.
                                    The reason this is so important is that when traders get into the market, they often mistake a string of profits or losses as either skill or lack of skill, which is simply not true. Whether a short-term trader makes multiple trades or an investor makes only a few trades per year, we need to analyze the outcomes of their trades in a different way to understand if they are merely "lucky" or if actual skill is involved. It's important to remember that statistics apply to all timelines.    
                                </p>

                                <h3>Long-Term Results</h3>
                                <p>The above example gave a short-term trade example based on a 50% chance of being right or wrong. But does this apply to the long term? Very much so. The reason is that even though a trader may only take long-term positions, they will be doing fewer trades. Thus, it will take longer to attain data from enough trades to see if simple luck is involved or if it was skill. A short-term trader may make 30 trades a week and show a profit every month for two years. Has this trader overcome the odds with real skill? It would seem so, as the odds of having a run of 24 profitable months are extremely rare unless the odds have shifted more in the trader's favor somehow.
                                    What about a long-term investor who has made three trades over the last two years that have been profitable? Is this trader exhibiting skill? Not necessarily. Currently, this trader has a run of three going, and that is not difficult to accomplish even from totally random results. The lesson here is that skill is not just reflected in the short term (whether that is one day or one year, it will differ by trading strategy); it will also be reflected in the long term. We need enough trade data to accurately determine whether a strategy is effective enough to overcome random probabilities. And even with this, we face another challenge: While each trade is an event, so is a month and year in which trades were placed.
                                </p>
                                <p>A trader who placed 30 trades a week has overcome the daily odds and the monthly odds for a good number of periods. Ideally, proving the investment strategy over a few more years would erase all doubt that luck was involved due to a certain market condition. For our long-term trader making trades that last more than a year, it will take several more years to prove that the strategy is profitable over this longer time frame and in all market conditions.
                                    When we consider all time frames and all market conditions, we begin to see how to be profitable in all time frames and how to move the odds more on our side, attaining greater than a random 50% chance of being right. It is worth noting that if profits are larger than losses, a trader can be right less than 50% of the time and still make a profit.

                                <h3>How Profitable Traders Make Money</h3>
                                <p>Of course, people do make money in the markets, and it's not just because they have had a good run. How do we get the odds in our favor? The profitable results come from two concepts. The first is based on what was discussed above—being profitable in all time frames, or at least winning more in certain periods than is lost in others.
                                    The second concept is the fact that trends exist in the markets, and this no longer makes the markets a 50/50 gamble as in our coin toss example. Stock prices tend to run in a certain direction over periods of time, and they have done this repeatedly over market history. For those of you who understand statistics, this proves that runs (trends) in stocks occur. Thus we end up with a probability curve that is not normal (remember that bell curve your teachers always talked about) but is skewed and commonly referred to as a curve with a fat tail (see the chart below). This means that traders can be profitable on a consistent basis if they use trends, even if it is in an extremely short time frame.

                                <h3>How To Overcome The Odds Of Trading Forex</h3>
                                <p>It is one of the hardest jobs in the world to make big money. And trading forex is
                                    not one of the easiest ways – despite what many new traders believe. Many traders
                                    fail, and they empty their trading accounts before they learn how to exploit the
                                    forex market to their advantage. Although there are also traders who are successful
                                    in forex trading, their numbers are small compared to the majority of losers. Many
                                    times, traders are not aware that they have the power and might to shift the odds to
                                    their favour, that they can dramatically increase their chances of success if they
                                    want to. The main reason why many traders get defeated by the market can be
                                    attributed to their lack of knowledge.
                                </p>

                                <p>In this 21st century, where the buzzword is knowledge, it is not just a matter of
                                    working hard, but also a matter of working smart. Knowledge is the key that can
                                    open many doors – if you have an intimate knowledge of how something works,
                                    you can then come up with ways to exploit what you know to your advantage. This
                                    applies to forex trading as well. Not only must you know and understand how the
                                    forex market works, you also need to understand your own emotions and other
                                    people’s emotions. You need to know how to identify high probability trade setups
                                    and how to manage your money wisely.
                                </p>
                                <p>For every transaction in the forex market, there are winners and losers. Your goal
                                    is to make more overall profits than losses over a period of time, and to emerge an
                                    overall winner. My approach to consistent trading success lies in three main pillars,
                                    or the 3Ms: Mind, Money and Method.
                                </p>
