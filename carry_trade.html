                        <h2>Carry Trade</h2>
                        <p>Is it possible to earn some passive income while you hold certain currency positions
                            over a period of time? The spot forex market offers just that opportunity. The Carry
                            Trade Strategy is a popular way of trading the global forex market, and is a strategy
                            highly favoured by large financial institutions such as hedge funds, pension funds
                            and banks. What makes carry trades so desirable is the possibility of earning
                            interest, which is a unique aspect that traders – both big and small alike – can take
                            advantage of.
                        </p>
                        <p>All currencies in the world have interest rates attached to them, and these rates are
                            decided by each country’s central bank. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank in
                            the US determines the country’s interest rates while the Bank of England sets the
                            United Kingdom’s interest rates. Since each country sets its own interest rate,
                            countries – or, rather, their currencies – are bound to have varying interest rates.
                            Some countries may have relatively higher interest rates while others may have
                            relatively lower rates. How can traders exploit the fact that some currencies have
                            much higher interest rates than others? Let me introduce you to the concept of a
                            carry trade.

                             <h3>What Is A Carry Trade?</h3>
                             <p>A carry trade is a long-term fundamental trading strategy that involves the selling
                                of a certain currency with a relatively low interest rate, and using the funds to buy
                                a currency which gives a higher interest rate, with the hope that the high-interestrate
                                currency will appreciate against the low-interest-rate-currency. When these
                                positions are held overnight, carry traders are paid interest on the currency they are
                                long in, and must pay interest on the currency they are shorting. The interesting
                                aspect of this strategy is that the investor or trader is able to gain the difference
                                between these two interest rates, known as the interest rate differential or spread,
                                which can be a hefty amount when leveraged.
                            </p>

                                • Currencies with typically low interest rates: JPY, CHF
                            </p>
                            <p>The Japanese yen and the Swiss franc tend to be on the selling side of the carry
                                trade due to their traditionally low interest rates. Such low-interest-rate currencies
                                are known as funding currencies since they are used to fund the purchase of high
                                interest rate currencies such as the British pound, the New Zealand dollar or the
                                Australian dollar which tend to have high interest rates.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Example: carry trade</h1>
                            <p>Here is an example of a carry trade. Let’s say the Japanese yen has
                                an interest rate of 0.25%, and the New Zealand dollar gives an
                                interest rate of 7.25%. Since the New Zealand dollar has a higher
                                interest rate than the Japanese yen, a trader who wishes to profit
                                from a carry trade may buy the New Zealand dollar and sell the
                                Japanese yen at the same time. An annualised profit of around 7%
                                (7.25% - 0.25%) may be reaped from the carry trade if no leverage is
                                used. This return is based on the assumption that the exchange rate
                                between the New Zealand dollar and Japanese yen remains
                                unchanged throughout the holding period of one year. If that carry
                                trade is carried out with a 10 times leverage, it will increase the
                                unleveraged 7% annualised return to a huge 70% annualised return. <br>
                                The conventional notation of currency pairs is such that JPY and
                                CHF tend to be the counter currency while GBP, NZD and AUD tend
                                to be the base currency in a currency pair. Hence, traders who are
                                interested in carry trades will long currency pairs like GBP/JPY,
                                AUD/JPY or NZD/CHF, effectively buying the first currency in each
                                pair (which also tends to be the higher-yielding currency) and
                                simultaneously selling the second currency in the pair (which tends
                                to be the lower-yielding currency). Since they are trading these
                                currency pairs in the long direction, they will want the base or highyielding
                                currencies to strengthen in value against the counter or lowyielding
                                currencies.

                                <h3>More Money Will Follow The Money</h3>
                                <p>Global institutional investors, such as hedge funds and banks, are constantly on the
                                    lookout for the highest rate of return on their funds, and have no qualms about
                                    shifting their money around, in the global sense. This act of shifting huge amounts
                                    of money into high-yielding assets lays the foundation of the carry trade, since a
                                    carry trade is all about borrowing money at low interest rates and then using the
                                    funds to purchase higher yielding financial instruments from elsewhere, which can
                                    include bonds or even cash itself.
                                </p>
                                <p>For quite some time, institutional or individual investors have been able to enjoy
                                    and exploit the large interest rate spread between US and Japan. Investors were
                                    drawn to borrowing the Japanese yen at near zero percent interest rate and using the
                                    money to buy US treasury bonds which gave them a much higher rate of return. The
                                    conversion of Japanese yen into US dollars for the purchase of the US bonds has
                                    resulted into a form of carry trade even though the asset may not be in cash because
                                    these assets are nonetheless denominated in the high-interest-rate currency. So it
                                    does not matter if investors are moving their money into bonds, currencies or other
                                    instruments, because it is ultimately cash that is changing hands.
                                </p>
                                <p>This conversion from one currency to another is significant if it is done on a large
                                    scale as an increased demand for that high-interest-rate currency will cause that
                                    currency to appreciate against the low-yielding currency. Usually, birds of the same
                                    feather will flock together, with money attracting more money to the same place as
                                    other investors follow suit. Forex traders, sensing this snowballing effect, will then
                                    execute carry trades in the currency market, with the hope that there will be a
                                    continued demand for the high-yielding currency as they can then profit from the
                                    interest spread as well as from capital appreciation.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Factors Supportive Of Carry Trades</h3>
                                <h1>Good economic and political conditions of the high-yielding currency</h1>
                                <p>When it comes to deciding where to invest their money, investors will not only
                                    assess the rate of return, but also the economic conditions and political stability of
                                    the country which holds the assets. Generally speaking, developed countries that
                                    offer relatively high interest rates are those which tend to experience decent
                                    economic growth and expansion, which may in turn attract more foreign
                                    investment into their country. An economy that is doing reasonably well will more
                                    likely be able to pay high interest rates to investors. However, it is not just the more
                                    developed countries that may offer high interest rates; many emerging economies
                                    may do so as well, simply because they tend to experience higher inflation. These
                                    are generally not countries where most investors will park their money due to the
                                    high level of economic instability.
                                </p>
                                <p>Political stability is also another aspect that investors are concerned with because a
                                    politically stable country will provide a good framework for trade and investment.
                                    Adverse economic and/or political conditions could have a negative impact on
                                    foreign investment in the country, and may cause investors to move their assets out
                                    and convert the high-yielding currency into their local currencies, thus resulting in
                                    depreciation in exchange rates of the carry pair.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Widening interest rate gap</h1>
                                <p>The wider the difference in interest rates between the two currencies in a pair, the
                                    higher the interest that will be paid to traders who long the carry pair (with the highyielding
                                    currency as the first currency in the pair) over a period of time. And the
                                    higher the interest fees that will be paid, the more it will attract other traders or
                                    investors to enter carry trades, thereby potentially pushing up the value of the highyielding
                                    currency further as demand for it increases.
                                </p>

                                <p>On the other hand, a narrowing interest rate gap between the two currencies will
                                    cause traders and investors to lose interest in holding their carry trades and
                                    discourage more people from joining in the carry trades as the interest fees paid out
                                    will decrease. Such a scenario can occur when interest rate hikes are expected to
                                    take place in the country of the low-yielding currency, thereby lifting the currency
                                    from the current low interest rate, or when interest rates are expected to be cut in
                                    the country of the high-yielding currency.
                                    So as a rule of thumb, the wider the interest rate gap exists between the two
                                    currencies, the higher the likelihood of a profitable long-term carry trade.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Risks Involved In Carry Trade</h3>
                                <p>The biggest risk in the Carry Trade Strategy is the uncertainty of future exchange
                                    rate fluctuations.
                                    For a carry trade to work, the high-yielding currency must rise, or at the very least
                                    remain steady, against the low-yielding one over a period of time.Adepreciation of
                                    the high-yielding currency can cause carry traders to lose money, as they are betting
                                    on an unchanged or a rising exchange rate of the currency pair, and this decline can
                                    even erase any gains earned from the interest.
                                </p>
                                <p>For example, if you go long on a currency pair like NZD/JPY as a carry trade, you
                                    expect and want the New Zealand dollar to appreciate in value or at least remain
                                    unchanged versus the Japanese yen for however long you intend to hold your
                                    position for. If NZD/JPY goes up, you will stand to gain not just from the interest
                                    spread, but also from capital appreciation. The risk then is for the carry trade pair
                                    to decline more in percentage than what you would gain from the interest fees.
                                </p>
                                <h1>You must understand the fundamentals</h1>
                                <p>If you are thinking of employing the Carry Trade Strategy, you must first
                                    understand the fundamental factors that are supportive of carry trades, and be
                                    confident that the high-yielding currency will continue to rise or stay unchanged
                                    against the low-yielding currency over a period of time. Should market sentiment
                                    reverse and change due to economic, monetary or political conditions, carry traders
                                    may decide to liquidate their long positions (by selling), perceiving that the highyielding
                                    currency would drop in value, and thus harm their long trades. This
                                    unwinding can come about quickly and without much warning, and can usually last
                                    for quite some time (months or even years) especially if overall perception towards
                                    the currencies in the carry pair is changed drastically based on major fundamental
                                    changes. Another reason for the possible prolonged unwinding of carry trades is
                                    that not all carry trades will unwind at the same time.
