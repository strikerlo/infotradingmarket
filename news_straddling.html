                            <p>In this era where information can be an extremely powerful and strategic asset,
                                whether to individuals or corporations, and information equals money, especially
                                for a trader, shutting yourself off from news can be suicidal. The forex market is
                                extremely sensitive to the flow of news that is related to it, and major short-term
                                currency moves are almost always preceded by changes in fundamental views
                                influenced by the news. Traders around the world make a living by processing and
                                translating information into money. Financial news services providers know how
                                important news is to the forex market players, and charge a premium for it. It is not
                                uncommon to get hundreds of headlines of news that are potentially relevant to
                                forex trading from any news service provider on an average trading day.
                            </p>
                            <p>Traders, especially those who day trade the forex market, require the latest up-tothe-
                                second news updates so as to facilitate their trading decisions which have to be
                                made at lightning speed. They mostly make use of online financial newswire
                                services such as Dow Jones Newswires, Bloomberg and Reuters, which display the
                                latest financial news on their computer monitors. Since the speed of news
                                dissemination is very important to traders, many opt for these online instant news
                                services rather than depending on daily newspapers like the Wall Street Journal or
                                the Financial Times which carry stale news that is of little use to traders.

                            <h3>The Importance of News</h3>
                            <p>News that is of great importance to forex traders is generally related to a country’s
                                economic, monetary and political situations, and socio-political events that are
                                happening around the world, with special attention on the Middle-East and isolated
                                countries in Asia like North Korea.
                                The underlying reason why news is so important to forex trading is that each new
                                piece of information can potentially alter the trader’s perceptions of the current
                                and/or future situation relating to the outlook of certain currency pairs. When
                                people’s opinions or beliefs are changed, they tend to act on these changed
                                perceptions through buying or selling actions in the forex market. Based on the
                                news, these traders will be preparing to cover their existing positions or to initiate
                                new positions. A trader’s action is based on the expectation that there will be a
                                follow-through in prices when other traders see and interpret the same news in a
                                similar way that he or she has, and adopt the same directional bias as the trader as
                                a result.
                            </p>
                            <p>News is a very important catalyst of short-term price movements because of the
                                expected impact it has on other market players, and this is in a way an anticipatory
                                reaction on the part of the trader as he or she assumes that other traders will be
                                affected by the news as well.
                                If the news happens to be bullish, say for the US dollar, traders who react the fastest
                                will be among the first to buy the US dollar, followed soon by other traders who
                                may react slower to the news or are waiting for certain technical criteria to be met
                                before jumping onto the bandwagon. And there will be those who join in the buying
                                frenzy at a later stage when they get hold of the delayed news in the morning
                                newspapers or from their brokers. This progressive entry of US dollar bulls over a
                                period of time is what sustains the upward move of the US dollar against another
                                currency, with the USD exchange rate going higher against other currencies. The
                                reverse is true for bearish news, traders will sell because they know that others will
                                soon be selling, thus pushing the USD exchange rate down. This is based on the
                                assumption that since other traders will be getting the same pieces of news, they
                                will be also tend to be affected the same way.
                            </p>

                                access to these wires can tap into the information given out, and react accordingly
                                in the forex market. However, institutional players do get information that retail
                                traders don’t, as they get privy access to order book information in their computer
                                systems, and may also know something that others don’t through their personal
                                contacts in the industry.
                            </p>
                            <p>In the world of forex trading, there are no rules or restrictions against insider
                                trading! Anyone who possesses information that is known only to a select few can
                                and do trade that information in the forex market. Sometimes, such news may give
                                an unfair advantage to these institutional players, but at other times, this isolated news access may not translate into real market action if other players do not have
                                that information.
                                Think of it this way: The forex market is dependent on news, for if there is no news,
                                there would be little or negligible price movements in the market. Even if
                                currencies may move according to the technicals sometimes, the technicals have
                                been established previously by news or expectations of future news, and so the
                                influence of news on currency prices is inevitable and inescapable.

                            <h1>Market reaction to news is staggered</h1>
                            <p>The market’s reaction to news is specific as it depends on both the type of medium
                                that the news is transmitted on and the type of news that is being released. Most
                                active traders get their market information from electronic market news services,
                                all of which relay information to the traders’ computer screens at almost exactly the
                                same time as soon as market events occur, with very slight or no discernible delay
                                between the actual time of release and the display of news. Other less active traders
                                may rely on daily market commentaries written by analysts, and published on
                                websites or in newspapers as they feel they have no need to for real-time news. The
                                market’s reaction can thus be staggered, ranging from an immediate reaction
                                (within the first second) from those who receive real-time news, to a more delayed
                                reaction from those who obtain the same news hours or even days later.

                            <p>It is not uncommon for the forex economic calendar to be packed with an average
                                of twenty economic news releases per trading day. The market reacts differently to
                                different news; some news may produce little or no reaction at all.
                                Due to the overflowing amount of forex-related information invading the
                                newswires and other media, you have to be very selective of what news to focus on
                                as the market reacts to a varying degree in relation to the type of news that is
                                released. During times of scheduled news releases, currency prices adjust very
                                rapidly to the market’s perceptions of the released data or comments relating to the
                                data. Since prices react very fast to news, it does not really matter whether the
                                information is accurate or not, as precious time cannot be spared to double-check
                                the facts.
                            </p>
                            <p>The market reacts to the “what” of the news, not the “why”. For example, currency
                                prices will move as the market reacts to the better than expected unemployment
                                figure. The market will not have time to be concerned about why the
                                unemployment rate is better this month compared to the previous month. If a trader
                                were to ponder why a particular piece of economic data is good or bad, instead of
                                taking advantage of the situation, he or she might as well be an analyst, not a trader,
                                as traders do not usually need to concern themselves with the “why”.

                            <h1>The discounting effect</h1>
                            <p>Very often, I get traders asking me why a particular currency has rallied despite that
                                country’s negative economic figures, or why the currency has declined despite
                                positive news (see the following chart). To a newcomer, that cause and effect may
                                seem a bit bewildering and confusing, but that is perfectly understandable. When
                                there is good economic news about a country, say, the United Kingdom,
                                commonsense says that the British pound should go up accordingly as investors and
                                traders get bullish on the economy; if the country shows signs of economic
                                weakness, the pound should go down accordingly to reflect the underlying
                                fundamentals of the country. The reason as to why a particular currency has gone
                                up despite poor economic data from that country, (or has declined despite positive
                                economic data) can be attributed to the discounting mechanism of the forex market.</p>
