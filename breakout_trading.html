                        <h2>Breakout Trading</h2>
                        <p>Despite the notoriety associated with trading breakouts, it remains one of the most
                            basic concepts in trading. A breakout typically occurs when the currency price
                            moves beyond a period of consolidation or trading range, or when the price
                            penetrates above or below an established price level, which can be a resistance or
                            support level, resulting in a follow-through of prices past those levels, whether
                            temporarily or permanently. The price movement past a breakout point can either
                            be a short or a more sustained affair, and that may depend on the time frame of
                            prices that you are looking at.
                        </p>

                        <p>Even though big market players tend to fade breakouts, and it is better for retail
                            traders to side with these players, it does not mean that trading breakouts is entirely
                            a bad idea. Breakout trading does have merits, and a different set of rules as
                            compared to fading breakouts.
                        </p>
                        <p>As mentioned on <a href="https://info-tradingmarket.com/breakout_fading.html">breakout fading</a>, it is better to first assume that any
                            breakout from a significant level is false, as false breakouts are more common than
                            successful breakouts. However, there are times when trading breakouts can be very
                            profitable, even though breakouts are known to be technically unstable. Hence, in
                            order to trade breakouts with a higher probability of success, you have to
                            incorporate as many market factors as possible, including both technical and
                            fundamental analysis, to get a better feel of the current overall market sentiment.
                        </p>
                        <h1>The problem of lack of volume data</h1>
                        <p>While volume is critical to the trading of breakout in other asset classes like stocks
                            or futures, in the forex market traders lack the knowledge of volume since there is
                            no central exchange to monitor all the transactions that have gone through or are
                            going through. Lack of forex volume data is a huge disadvantage to forex traders
                            as volume often reveals where the market is positioned or is positioning, and is
                            often an important criteria of any breakout trading strategies as successful
                            breakouts are generally accompanied by a rise in volume. In view of that, you have
                            to rely on several guidelines so that you can position yourself for a potentially
                            good breakout.
                        </p>

                            <h1>What are the types or categories of breakouts?</h1>
                            <p>When a price attempts a breakout of a significant support or resistance level, it
                                signals a change in the balance of supply and demand, and such a change may be
                                triggered by a change in market sentiment, or a renewed resolution of bulls or bears
                                of a currency pair, or the unfolding of certain fundamental events. Successful
                                breakouts must be accompanied with a strong surge of momentum in the direction
                                of the price breakout.
                            </p>
                            <p>Price breakouts can be categorised into two main types: <br>
                                1. continuation breakouts, and <br>
                                2. reversal breakouts.
                            </p>
                            <p>According to the basic tenet of technical analysis, one should always assume the
                                underlying trend to continue unless proved otherwise, and it is no exception in
                                this case.

                                <p>In a continuation breakout, currency prices break out of established price levels to

                                    by falling lower in a downtrend. Usually, a breakout occurs after a period of
                                    consolidation in which when buyers and sellers of a currency pair regroup and
                                    contemplate the next price move (See illustration below).

                                <p>Sometimes, a current trend may be near its last stage, and could be in the process
                                    of reversing as the hype fuelling the trend is extinguished. In such a situation, a
                                    breakout could lead to a trend reversal and the beginning of a new trend, hence it
                                    being a reversal breakout (See illustration below).
                                </p>

                                <h3>False breakouts</h3>
                                <p>However, there are many times when prices do not move in a straightforward
                                    direction (whether continuation or reversal) in the real trading world. Traders
                                    observing a price breakout could be treated to a display of the infamous false
                                    breakout which all breakout traders fear and detest. A false breakout occurs when
                                    the price has pierced through the support or resistance level, but then retreats back
                                    into the previous price zone, thus stopping out most breakout traders if their stops
                                    are just below the support or above the resistance level. Institutional players are
                                    often the culprits behind false breakouts as they manipulate the currency price past
                                    common stop levels so as to deliberately clean out that side of the market.
                                </p>
                                <p>The worst kind of breakout is the whipsaw type, whereby prices move out of the
                                    price range, then back into the range, and then break out of the level again, stopping
                                    both breakout traders and faders at least once (See Figure 8.3).Awhipsaw breakout
                                    usually occurs when there is lack of momentum behind the price move or when the
                                    breakout is small and weak. What makes a breakout unsustainable is the lack of
                                    subsequent waves of buyers or sellers of a currency pair to generate more buying
                                    or selling interest in an upside or downside breakout respectively after the first wave of buyers or sellers has jumped in shortly after the breakout. Sometimes, the
                                    price action can be so choppy that it is better to stay out of the market.

                                    first broke out by 30 pips from the resistance level, then went back into the prebreakout
                                    zone, and then broke out of the resistance level again. Such whipsaw
                                    action tends to stop out both breakout traders and faders in the process.

                                <p>With so many different outcomes of a breakout, all breakouts must be treated with
                                    some degree of suspicion, even if you have iron-clad reasons not to doubt the
                                    direction of your trade, they all carry some risk of failure. That is when reasonably
                                    placed stops can help preserve the rest of your capital when a price breakout does
                                    not go your way.
