                        <p>One of the most important skill that you need as a trader is the ability
                            to read the market structure, it is a critical skill that will allow you to
                            use the right price action strategies in the right market condition.

                        <p>
                            You are not going to trade all the markets the same way; you need to
                            study how the markets move, and how traders behave in the market.
                            The market structure is the study of the market behavior.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And if you can master this skill, when you open your chart, you will be
                            able to answer these important questions:
                            What the crowds are doing? Who is in control of the market buyers or
                            sellers? What is the right time and place to enter or to exit the market
                            and when you need to stay away?
                            Through your price action analysis, you will experience three types of
                            markets, trending markets, ranging markets, and choppy markets.

                                <h3>Trending markets</h3>
                                <p>Trending markets are simply characterized by a repeating pattern of
                                    higher highs and higher low in an up-trending market, and lower high
                                    and lower low in a down trending market.
                                </p>
                                <img src="image/trending market.png" width="100%" height="75%" alt="trending market example">
                                <p>As you can see in the example above, the market is making series of
                                    higher highs and higher lows which indicates that the market is up
                                    trending.
                                </p>
                                <p>You don’t need indicators to decide if it is bullish or bearish just a visual
                                    observation of price action is quite enough to get an idea about the
                                    market trend.
                                </p>
                                <p>Look another example of a downtrend market.</p>
                                <img src="image/down trend.png" width="100%" height="360px" alt="downtrend example">
                                <p>The example above shows a bearish market, as you can see there are
                                    series of higher lows and lower low which indicate an obvious
                                    downtrend.
                                </p>
                                <p>Trending markets are easy to identify, don’t try to complicate your
                                    analysis, use your brain and see what the market is doing.
                                </p>
                                <p>If it is doing series of higher highs and higher low, it is simply an
                                    uptrend market; conversely, if it is making series of lower highs and
                                    lower low, it is obviously a downtrend market.
                                </p>
                                <p>According to statistics, trends are estimated to occur 30% of the time,
                                    so while they are in motion, you've got to know how to take advantage
                                    of them.
                                </p>
                                <p>To determine whether a market is trending or not, you have to use
                                    bigger time frames such the 4H, the daily or the weekly time frame.
                                    Never try to use smaller time frames to determine the market
                                    structure.
                                </p>

                                <h3>ranging markets</h3>
                                <p>Ranging markets are pretty straight forward, they are often called
                                    sideways markets, because their neutral nature makes them appear to
                                    drift to the right, horizontally.
                                </p>
                                <p>When the market makes a series of higher highs and higher lows, we
                                    can say that the market is trending up.
                                    But when it stops making these consecutive peaks, we say that the
                                    market is ranging.
                                </p>
                                <p>A ranging market moves in a horizontal form, where buyers and sellers
                                    just keep knocking price back and forth between the support and the
                                    resistance level.
                                </p>
                                <a href="https://grbounty.link/resources/hit/1262/egqcqfRWtj"><img src="https://grbounty.link/resources/view/1262/egqcqfRWtj" alt="Tools to sell knowledge online"/></a>
                                <p>See the example below:</p>
                                <img src="ranging market.png" width="100%" height="320px" alt="ranging market example">
                                <p>The chart above shows a ranging market, as you can see, the price is
                                    bouncing between horizontal support and resistance level.
                                </p>
                                <p>The difference between trending markets and ranging markets is that
                                    trending markets tend to move by forming a pattern of higher high and
                                    higher lows in case of an uptrend, and higher low and lower low in case
                                    of a downtrend.
                                </p>
                                <p>But ranging markets tend to move horizontally between key support
                                    and resistance levels.
                                </p>
                                <p>Your understanding of the difference between the both markets will
                                    help you better use the right price action strategies in the right market
                                    conditions.
                                </p>
                                <p>Trading ranging markets is completely different from trading trending
                                    markets, because when the market is ranging, it creates equilibrium,
                                    buyers are equal to sellers, and there is no one in control.
                                </p>
                                <a href="https://grbounty.link/resources/hit/1262/egqcqfRWtj"><img src="https://grbounty.link/resources/view/1262/egqcqfRWtj" alt="Tools to sell knowledge online"/></a>
                                <p>This will generally continue until the range structures broke out , and
                                    a trending condition start to organize.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Choppy Markets</h3>
                                <p>In Forex, choppy markets are those which have no clear directions,
                                    when you open your chart, and you find a lot of noise, you can’t even
                                    decide if the market is ranging, or trending.
                                </p>
                                <p>You have to know that you are watching a choppy market. This type of
                                    markets can make you feel very emotional and doubt your trading
                                    strategies as it starts to drop in performance.
                                </p>
                                <p>The best way to determine if a market is choppy is just by zooming out
                                    on the daily chart and taking in the bigger picture.
                                </p>
                                <p>After some training, screen time and experience, you will easily be able
                                    to identify if a market is ranging or it is a choppy market.
                                </p>
                                <p>Here is a good example of a choppy chart that is not worth trading.</p>
                                <img src="choppy market.png" width="100%" height="320px" alt="choppy market example">
                                <p>Notice in the chart above, the price action in the highlighted area is
                                    very choppy, and it is moving sideways in a very small tight range. This
                                    is a sign of a choppy market that you should stay away from.
                                </p>
                                <p>If a market is choppy, in my opinion, it is not worth trading, if you try
                                    to trade it, you will give back your profits shortly after big winners,
                                    because markets often consolidate after making big moves.
                                </p>
                                <h3>What is Spot Forex Market Structure</h3>
                                <p>The spot forex market has always been a decentralised global network of buyers
                                    and sellers – meaning there is no physical central exchange that acts as a central
                                    clearing party. This is unlike, say, stocks or futures which traded through the
                                    exchanges such the London Stock Exchange or Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
                                </p>
                                <p>Trading of currencies is done OTC (over-the-counter), in the sense that currency
                                    buyers and sellers from all over the world make a binding contract with each other
                                    after agreeing on a price – and this is not carried out through an exchange. This
                                    aspect of spot forex trading is different from forex futures trading which is carried
                                    out through an exchange. Forex traders carry out their activities by dealing directly
                                    with one another or through brokers via telephone and internet connections.
                                </p>
                                <h3>FX Market Space when and where</h3>
                                <p>In early 2007, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Reuters launched the
                                    world’s first centrally cleared global forex market place called FXMarketSpace.
                                </p>
                                <p>There are several benefits of a central exchange, for example:</p>
                                <ul style="font-size: 10.5pt;">
                                    <li><b>counterparty risk</b> for trades is reduced, and</li>
                                    <li>there is <b>trading anonymity</b> – something very much coveted, especially for big players.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>In this centrally cleared system, the CME will act as the central counterparty and
                                    guarantee the performance of all contracts for both buyers and sellers.
                                    Unfortunately, FXMarketSpace is an institutional trading platform and is not open
                                    to retail market players. According to the website (www.fxmarketspace.com),
                                    market participants would have to meet the FSA (Financial Services Authority is
                                    based in the United Kingdom) definition of a “Market Counterparty”, and
                                    individuals would have to be sophisticated investors, typically with a net worth
                                    over $20 million.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Market Players</h3>
                                <p>The OTC nature of the forex market means that currency transactions do not
                                    converge at one single place, but instead are conducted all over the globe. Players
                                    of the forex market range from those who trade billions of dollars a day, to those
                                    who trade just tens of thousands of dollars.
                                </p>
                                <p>A player’s access to the forex market depends on their quantity of transactions of
                                    large amounts of money. The world’s big banks are the main market players, and
                                    they form the exclusive club where most trading activities take place. This club is
                                    known as the interbank market. The more money you have, or are able to get a
                                    credit for, the more likely you are able to access this big boys’ club.
                                </p>
                                <p>Down the hierarchy are the smaller banks, big multinational companies, hedge
                                    funds and other institutional investors or speculators, and retail forex brokers.
                                    These large speculators may also conduct currency transactions directly in the
                                    interbank market, if they deal in large amounts and have credit standings with the
                                    large banks.

                                    generally trade in much smaller lot sizes.
                                    Central banks of countries are also market players, although they are not always
