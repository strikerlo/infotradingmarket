                        <p>Support and resistance levels, whether they are found amidst chart patterns,
                            indicators or along trendlines, are an indication of where a predictable price
                            response can be expected. A support level is where buying pressure overwhelms
                            selling pressure enough to interrupt or reverse a downtrend. A sturdy support level
                            is more likely to hold up even if prices slightly pierce through the support, and that
                            presents traders with an excellent buying opportunity.
                        </p>
                        <p>Conversely, a resistance level is where selling pressure is strong enough to
                            overcome buying pressure such that an uptrend can be stopped temporarily or
                            reversed. A strong resistance level is more likely to block further advance even if
                            prices slightly pierce through the resistance, and such a situation presents traders
                            with an excellent shorting opportunity.
                        </p>
                        <p>You can take advantage of such opportunities by fading breakouts.
                            Fading breakouts refers to trading against breakouts, when you believe that the
                            currency prices will not be able to sustain a follow-through action in the direction
                            of the breakout. We fade breakouts when we expect breakouts from support and
                            resistance levels to be false and unsustainable, especially when those support and
                            resistance levels are of great significance. Many breakouts tend to fail at the first
                            few attempts, and that makes fading breakouts an excellent short-term strategy for
                            forex traders. Fading breakouts tends to be more effective as a short-term strategy,
                            and is not meant for the long-term. False breakouts, also known as fakeouts, are a
                            bane for breakout traders, but boon for breakout faders.

                        <h3>The Crowd Likes to Trade Breakouts</h3>
                            <p>The idea of trading breakouts appeals to many independent traders, especially
                                newcomers to the currency market. Support and resistance levels are seen as price
                                floor and price ceiling respectively. A support level attracts buyers’ enthusiasm for
                                higher bids, and prevents the price from going lower, while a resistance level
                                attracts sellers’ enthusiasm for shorting, and prevents the price from advancing
                                higher. Thus, it is perfectly logical for the crowd to think that if the support level is
                                penetrated, then the general price move should be downward, and hence they are
                                more likely to sell than to buy. The opposite is true for a price break above a
                                resistance level. When that happens, the crowd will usually come to the conclusion
                                that if the resistance level is penetrated, then prices are more likely to advance
                                higher in a rally, and hence they are more likely to buy than to sell.
                            </p>
                            <p>Knowing this, it is very easy to see why there tends to be a big cluster of entry stop
                                orders placed just above a resistance level and also placed just below a
                                support level.
                                However, the cluster of stop orders there does not just comprise entry orders, but
                                also stop-loss orders placed by traders who have bought near the support level, or
                                have sold near the resistance level. So if the currency price crosses above the
                                resistance level, short positions will be stopped out. In an opposite fashion, long
                                positions will be stopped out when the currency price crosses below the
                                support level.
                            </p>

                                <h3>Why Most Breakouts Fail</h3>
                                <p>One of the most compelling reasons why most breakouts tend to fail is due to the
                                    fact that winners need to take money from losers, and it does not always pay to have
                                    the same mentality as the crowd, as the majority will crash out of the trading game
                                    broke. Money has to be made from the majority, not from the minority who get it
                                    right. The crowd holds the dumb money with weak hands, whereas the smart
                                    money tends to belong to the domain of big players who can afford to reach into
                                    their deep pockets for a couple of tricks to sabotage the crowd. The most money is
                                    made when the crowd turns out to be wrong, because then these players will
                                    scramble to get out of their losing positions, causing vertical rallies or declines.
                                </p>
                                <p>If almost everyone, ranging from people hanging out in online forums to your
                                    neighbours, see the same great opportunity to buy above a resistance level or sell
                                    below a support level, who will be the sellers on the other side of the transaction?
                                    For someone to buy something, there must be a seller, and vice versa. Granted,
                                    there are not too many traders who are indeed unaware of such a level, so how can
                                    the majority make money from the minority? If there is so much market demand to
                                    buy above a resistance or sell below a support, the market maker has to absorb all
                                    those one-sided orders and take the other side of the equation. However, we must
                                    be aware that the market maker is certainly no fool.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Trading against the crowd</h1>
                                <p>I have increasingly noticed that obvious support and resistance levels on the
                                    currency price charts tend to provide the best opportunities for fading breakouts,
                                    although it is not always the case. This is not surprising, given the fact that the most
                                    well-recognised price levels or chart patterns will be detected by the majority of
                                    traders. Almost everyone is taught the same aspects of technical analysis from
                                    books or other sources, and new traders are the ones who tend to most eagerly
                                    follow trade recommendations stemming from the formation of certain chart
                                    patterns on the currency price charts.

                                <p>Retail traders like to trade breakouts, but institutional, or the more seasoned traders,
                                    prefer to fade breakouts, doing exactly the opposite of what the majority is
                                    expected to do. That is one of the main reasons why most breakouts fail – the
                                    institutional or seasoned traders taking advantage of the crowd psychology of the
                                    retail or inexperienced traders, and winning at their expense. Our strategy is to trade
                                    in the direction of institutional activity, by fading breakouts.

                                    <h3>Tricks of Institutional Dealers and Traders</h3>
                                    <p>Before I talk about the Breakout Fading Strategy, let’s understand a bit more about
                                        the kind of tricks that are played by institutional dealers and traders.
                                        Many market makers, banks, and hedge funds – mainly big players with deep
                                        pockets – are known to fade breakouts, which are traded by many retail traders.
                                        Their game plan is to make money from the majority of the crowd who thinks that
                                        the price will rally merrily after an upside breakout or decline dangerously after a
                                        downside breakout. Since market makers are the pricing counterparties to their
                                        retail customers, they have to take the opposite end of your trade, whether you like
                                        it or not.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>First of all, let’s see things from their point of view. For example, if there is an
                                        expected crowd demand to buy at a certain price above a resistance level, these
                                        firms know that they will have to sell to their customers, so how will they position
                                        themselves in an advantageous position? What they routinely do is that they reach
                                        into their pockets, spend a bit of money buying up the currency pair to the level
                                        where stop entry (and stop-loss) orders have been placed by their customers, so that
                                        they can now sell to those people who are desperate to buy, thus making some
                                        decent profits from this trick.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The next stage of this trick comes when customers’ stop (both entry and exit) orders
                                        are triggered and the retail crowd goes long. This gives the market makers and other
                                        big players a chance to close the previous longs they entered by selling to the
                                        crowd. However, the big players know they can make money in both directions, so
                                        now they begin shorting to overwhelm the buying pressure from the crowd, thus
                                        pushing the currency prices down, back below the breakout level, where many
                                        stop-loss orders have been placed by the buyers who trade the upside breakout.
                                        These stop-loss orders then become executed, and the big players can gleefully
                                        offload all or some of their shorts by buying from those who are selling to close
                                        their losing breakout trades (See Illustration Below)
                                    </p>

                                        makers (denoted as “MMs”) pushed the currency pair up above the
                                        resistance level (1.9560) to trigger stops, and after taking their profits, they
                                        then pushed prices back down for further gains.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This is the story behind the false breakout – beautiful in the eyes of big institutional
                                        players; hideous and greatly undesirable in the eyes of the crowd. Hedge funds,
                                        with their immense capital, can play these tricks on the unsuspecting crowd as well,
                                        even though they trade only for themselves.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Market makers have the information of where their customers’ orders are from their
                                        order book. Even if these big players have good intentions, they could still
                                        potentially trade against you so as to cover imbalanced trades or to supply liquidity
                                        to the market. Of course, trading to maximise profits of their internal accounts
                                        cannot be ruled out. A potential conflict of interest can thus exist, and retail traders
                                        must know that in order to know how to protect themselves. After all, market
                                        makers exist to give profit to their share-holders, not to their customers.

                                    <p>When big players go on a stop hunting spree, false breakouts are likely to be the
                                        consequence of that. The crowd may think that the false breakout is due to the
                                        sudden turning of the market, but it is most likely the direct result of the games that
                                        big players play. Taking out stops placed by the crowd at predictable levels serve
                                        their monetary interests. Retail traders must know what these big players are doing or are thinking of doing in order to join in their game of scooping up money from
                                        the majority of the crowd.
                                        False breakouts also arise when market makers execute stops before the interbank
                                        market has reached those prices or execute stops that lie just outside the actual
                                        trading area. Sometimes you may see that prices have pierced slightly through the
                                        breakout level in intraday charts, or even longer-term charts like the daily charts,
                                        and then make a quick U-turn back into the pre-breakout price zone.

                                    <h3>Best market condition to fade breakouts</h3>
                                    <h1>what is the best market condition to fade breakouts</h1>
                                    <p>One persistent trading conundrum is for a trader to decide when is the best time to
                                        trade a breakout and when to trade against it. I know traders who only fade
                                        breakouts, and also people from the camp that only trade breakouts. In the forex
                                        trading business, good traders cannot afford to be rigid in their mindset and follow preconceived rules without much thoughts and analysis. The guidelines that I have
                                        laid out for fading breakouts, should be just that – guidelines, not definite rules
                                        carved in stone. Even though the general rule of thumb is to fade breakouts on the
                                        first attempt, you need to take into consideration the various circumstances that
                                        present optimal or less than ideal fading opportunities.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Adopt the Breakout Fading Strategy only when you sense a high probability of the
                                        market situation supporting it. Not only must you spot a good location to carry out
                                        this strategy, perfect timing is also a key ingredient to spotting an ideal fading
                                        opportunity. From my experience, the best market condition for fading breakouts is
                                        a range-bound market.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Range-bound markets</h3>
                                    <h1>Range-bound markets as the best market condition to fade breakouts</h1>
                                    <p>It is common knowledge that financial markets spend most of their time bouncing
                                        back and forth between a range of prices trapped between a support and resistance
                                        level, instead of always making fresh higher highs or lower lows in an uptrend or
                                        downtrend. The forex market is no exception, and tends to stay range-bound most
                                        of the time, in between trending phases.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Fading breakouts can be a very profitable trading strategy when the market is
                                        ranging. A range is bound by a support level and a resistance level which are in
                                        close proximity to each other, as buyers and sellers of a currency pair battle it out
                                        after either side has established an extreme overbought or oversold price zone. This
                                        period of consolidation settles the currency prices within a range, and may be
                                        manifested in the form of a rectangle (a horizontal channel) or a triangle, whereby
                                        neither bulls nor bears of a currency pair are stronger than the other. At some point,
                                        either the bulls or the bears will wrestle control and overpower the other party,
                                        marking the start of a trending phase again.

                                    <p>A trading range should consist of at least two contact points at the support and at
                                        the resistance levels drawn. It is preferable to fade breakouts at the third or even
                                        fourth contact points at these levels on the hourly or daily charts as they tend to be
                                        more reliable (See example below). Fading breakouts in a rectangle or triangle involves
                                        buying at the support line and selling at the resistance line at the third or fourth
                                        contact point on either side, unless there are overwhelming signs that the market is
                                        ready to trend again.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>The Breakout Fading Strategy tends not to work as well for strong trending phases
                                        of the market, and is more effective in range-bound market conditions. That said,
                                        you can still fade a breakout while in a strong trend, if you can contend with a very
                                        small profit objective of not more than 20-30 pips. So whether or not you fade a
                                        breakout during a trending phase really depends on your own preference, degree of
                                        risk appetite and experience in the market.
