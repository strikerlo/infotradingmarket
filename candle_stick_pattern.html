                        <h3>What are Candle Stick Pattern</h3>
                        <p>Candlestick patterns are one of the most powerful trading concepts,
                            they are simple, easy to identify, and very profitable setups, a research
                            has confirmed that candlestick patterns have a high predictive value
                            and can produce positive results.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I personally trade candlestick pattern for more than 20 years; i can’t really switch to another method, because i tried thousands of
                            strategies and trading methods with no results. I’m not going to introduce you to a holy grail, this trading system
                            works, but be prepared to lose some trades, losing is a part of this game, if you are looking for a 100% wining system, i highly recommend
                            you to stop trading and go look for another business.
                        </p>
                        <p>Candlestick patterns are the language of the market, imagine you are
                            living in a foreign country, and you don’t speak the language.
                            How could you live if you can’t even say a word? It’s tough right???The
                            same thing when it comes to trading.</p>

                            <p>The Engulfing bar as it states in its title is formed when it fully engulfs
                                the previous candle. The engulfing bar can engulf more than one
                                previous candle, but to be considered an engulfing bar, at least one
                                candle must be fully consumed.
                            </p>
                            <p>The <a style="color: red;">bearish engulfing</a> is one of the most important candlestick
                                patterns.
                            </p>
                            <p>This candlestick pattern consists of two bodies:</p>
                            <p>The first body is smaller than the second one, in other words, the
                                second body engulfs the previous one. See the illustration below:
                            </p>
                            <img src="image/engulfing bar.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="engulfing bar pattern example">
                            <p>This is how a bearish engulfing bar pattern looks like on your charts,
                                this candlestick pattern gives us valuable information about bulls and
                                bears in the market.
                            </p>
                            <p>In case of a bearish engulfing bar, this pattern tells us that sellers are
                                in control of the market.
                                When this pattern occurs at the end of an uptrend, this indicates that
                                buyers are engulfed by sellers which signals a trend reversal.
                            </p>
                            <p>see example below:</p>
                            <img src="image/bearish engulfing bar.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="bearish engulfing bar pattern example">
                            <p>As you can see when this price action pattern occurs in an uptrend, we
                                can anticipate a trend reversal because buyers are not still in control
                                of the market, and sellers are trying to push the market to go down.
                                You can’t trade any bearish candlestick pattern you find on your chart;
                                you will need other technical tools to confirm your entries.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>The <a style="color: red;">bullish engulfing bar</a> consists of two candlesticks, the first one is
                                the small body, and the second is the engulfing candle,
                            </p>
                            <p>see the illustration:</p>
                            <img src="image/bullish engulfing bar.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="bullish engulfing bar pattern example">
                            <p>The bullish engulfing bar pattern tells us that the market is no longer
                                under control of sellers, and buyers will take control of the market.
                                When a bullish engulfing candle forms in the context of an uptrend, it
                                indicates a continuation signal.
                                When a bullish engulfing candle forms at the end of a downtrend, the
                                reversal is much more powerful as it represents a capitulation bottom.
                            </p>
                            <p>See the example below:</p>
                            <img src="image/bullish engulfing example.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="bullish engulfing bar example">
                            <p>The example above shows us clearly how the market changes direction
                                after the formation of a bullish engulfing bar pattern.
                                The smaller body that represents the selling power was covered by the
                                second body that represents the buying power.
                                The color of the bodies is not important. What’s important is that the
                                smaller one is totally engulfed by the second candlestick.</p>
                            

                            <h3><a id="doji"></a><li>The Doji Candlestick pattern</li></h3>
                            <p>Doji is one of the most important Japanese candlestick patterns, when
                                this candlestick forms, it tells us that the market opens and closes at
                                the same price which means that there is equality and indecision
                                between buyers and sellers, there is no one in control of the market.
                            </p>
                            <p>See the example below:</p>
                            <img src="image/doji candle stick.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="doji candle stick example">
                            <p>As you can see the opening price is the same as the closing price, this
                                signal means that the market didn’t decide which direction will take.
                                When this pattern occurs in an uptrend or a downtrend, it indicates
                                that the market is likely to reverse.
                            </p>
                            <p>See another example below to learn more:</p>
                            <img src="image/doji candle stick eg.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="doji candle stick example">
                            <p>The chart above shows how the market changed direction after the
                                formation of the Doji candlestick. <br />
                                The market was trending up, that means that buyers were in control
                                of the market. <br />
                                The formation of the Doji candlestick indicates that buyers are unable
                                to keep price higher, and sellers push prices back to the opening price.
                                This is a clear indication that a trend reversal is likely to happen.
                            </p>

                            <p>The Dragonfly Doji is a bullish candlestick pattern which is formed
                                when the open high and close are the same or about the same price.
                                What characterizes the dragonfly Doji is the long lower tail that shows
                                the resistance of buyers and their attempt to push the market up.
                            </p>

                                lower tail suggests that the forces of supply and demand are nearing a
                                balance and that the direction of the trend may be nearing a major
                                turning point.

                                The formation of the dragonfly Doji with the long lower tail shows us
                                that there is a high buying pressure in the area.

                            <p>The Gravestone Doji is the bearish version of the dragonfly Doji, it is
                                formed when the open and close are the same or about the same
                                price.
                                What differentiates the Gravestone Doji from the dragonfly Doji is the
                                long upper tail.

                            <p>The formation of the long upper tail is an indication that the market is
                                testing a powerful supply or resistance area. <br />
                                See the example below:

                                open.
                                Later in the day sellers overwhelmed the market pushing the price

                                As you can see the pattern occurred at an obvious bearish trend.
                                The first candle confirmed the seller’s domination, and the second one
                                produces indecision in the market, the second candle could be a Doji,
                                or any other candle.

                            <p>But here, the Doji candle indicated that sellers are struggling to push
                                the market lower. The third bullish candle indicates that buyers took
                                control from sellers, and the market is likely to reverse.

                                that usually occurs at the top of an uptrend. <br/>
                                The pattern consists of three candlesticks:
                            </p>

                                <li>The second candle is a small candlestick, it can be bullish or bearish or
                                    it can be a Doji or any other candlestick.

                                <li>The third candle is a large bearish candle. In general, the evening star
                                    pattern is the bearish version of the morning star pattern. <br /> See the

                            <p>The first part of an evening star is a bullish candle; this means that bulls
                                are still pushing the market higher.
                                Right now, everything is going all right. The formation of the smaller
                                body shows that buyers are still in control but they are not as powerful
                                as they were.

                                and a possible bearish trend reversal is likely to happen.
                                <br /> See another chart that illustrates how the evening star could represent
                                a significant trend reversal signal.

                                The second one is a short candle indicating price consolidation and

                                than the previous candlestick indicating a confirmation of the

                                but they get rejected by buyers so the market closes higher than the

                                The long shadow represents the high buying pressure from this point.
