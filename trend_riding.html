                        <h2>Trend Riding</h2>
                        <h3>Who doesn’t like a trend</h3>
                        <p>Many traders live by the often-repeated “the trend is your friend until the end” rule;
                            they are comforted with the knowledge that they are with the majority of the
                            market. Being able to ride on a trend is akin to making full use of the wind direction
                            to steer your ship towards your destination. For a ship to go against the wind
                            requires a tremendous amount of effort – one has to fight the stubborn resistance
                            from the opposing wind. Indeed, for most of the time, it pays more to be on the side
                            of the current trend than to go against it. In the forex market, trend riders can
                            capture any trend regardless of whether it is rising or falling in an attempt to
                            generate trading profits.
                        </p>
                        <p>Forex tends to have quite trending markets, regardless of which time frame you are
                            looking at – trends are often formed on hourly, daily or weekly charts. This is due
                            to the fact that currency price movements are very much influenced by the
                            underlying macroeconomic factors which in turn shape the market players’ views
                            of where currency prices should be heading. With trends possibly having a long
                            lifespan stretching to months, or even years, it is no wonder that many traders and
                            fund managers exalt the strategy of hitching onto trends, with the glorious aim of
                            capturing enormous profits from start to finish.
                            Trend riding is one of my favourite trading approaches, and I often ride the uptrend
                            or downtrend after the trend has been established, rather than anticipating the move
                            before it happens. I would say that even though the trend is your friend most of the
                            times, one has to use a variety of methods to distinguish between a continuation of
                            the trend and a possible trend reversal. But before you can ride on trends, you first
                            need to identify what the current trend is, and to determine the time frame of
                            the trend.
                        </p>

                                <h3>Time Frames of Trends</h3>
                                <p>Sometimes, people ask me for my opinion on the current trend for certain currency
                                    pairs, I reply with another question in return, “According to the past 5 mins, 5
                                    hours, 5 days or 5 weeks?” Some traders are not aware that different trends exist in
                                    different time frames. The question of what kind of trend is in place cannot be
                                    separated from the time frame that a trend is in. Trends are, after all, used to
                                    determine the relative direction of prices in a market over different time periods.
                                </p>
                                <p>There are mainly three types of trends in terms of time measurement: <br>
                                    1. primary (long-term), <br>
                                    2. intermediate (medium-term), and <br>
                                    3. short-term. <br>
                                    These are discussed in further detail below.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Primary trend (long-term) </h1>
                                <p>Aprimary trend lasts the longest period of time, and its lifespan may range between
                                    eight months and two years. This is the major trend that can be spotted easily on
                                    longer term charts such as the daily, weekly or monthly charts. Long-term traders
                                    who trade according to the primary trend are the most concerned about the
                                    fundamental picture of the currency pairs that they are trading, since fundamental
                                    factors will provide these traders with an idea of supply and demand on a bigger
                                    scale.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Intermediate trend (medium-term)</h1>
                                <p>Within a primary trend, there will be counter-cyclical trends, and such price
                                    movements form the intermediate trend. This type of trend could last from a month
                                    to as long as eight months. Knowing what the intermediate trend is of great
                                    importance to the position trader who tends to hold positions for several weeks or
                                    months at one go.
                                </p>
                                <h1>Short-term trend</h1>
                                <p>A short-term trend can last for a few days to as long as a month. It appears during
                                    the course of the intermediate trend due to global capital flows reacting to daily
                                    economic news and political situations. Day traders are concerned with spotting
                                    and identifying short-term trends and as such short-term price movements are
                                    aplenty in the currency market, and can provide significant profit opportunities
                                    within a very short period of time.
                                </p>
                                <p>No matter which time frame you may trade, it is vital to monitor and identify the
                                    primary trend, the intermediate trend, and the short-term trend for a better overall
                                    picture of the trend.
                                </p>

                                        <p>In order to adopt the Trend Riding Strategy, you must first identify a trend
                                            direction.
                                            You can easily gauge the direction of a trend by looking at the price chart of a
                                            currency pair. A trend can be defined as a series of higher lows and higher highs in
                                            an uptrend, and a series of lower highs and lower lows in a downtrend. In reality,
                                            prices do not always go higher in an uptrend, but still tend to bounce off areas of
                                            support, just like prices do not always make lower lows in a downtrend, but still
                                            tend to bounce off areas of resistance.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>There are three trend directions a currency pair could take: <br>
                                            1. uptrend, <br>
                                            2. downtrend or <br>
                                            3. sideways.
                                        </p>
                                        <h1>Uptrend</h1>
                                        <p>In an uptrend, the base currency (which is the first currency symbol in a pair)
                                            appreciates in value. For example, if EUR/USD is in an uptrend, it means that EUR
                                            is rising higher against the USD. An uptrend is characterised by a series of higher
                                            highs and higher lows. However in real life, sometimes the currency does not make
                                            higher highs, but still makes higher lows. Base currency bulls (henceforth referred
                                            to simply as “bulls”) take charge during an uptrend, taking the opportunities to bid
                                            up the base currency whenever it goes a bit lower, believing that there will be more
                                            buyers at every step, hence pushing up the prices.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>On the other hand, in a downtrend, the base currency depreciates in value. For
                                            example, if EUR/USD is in a downtrend, it means that EUR is declining against the
                                            USD. A downtrend is characterised by a series of lower highs and lower lows, but
                                            similarly, the currency does not always make lower lows, but still tends to make
                                            lower highs. The downward slope of lower highs is formed by the base currency
                                            bears (will simply be known now as just “bears”) who take control during a
                                            downtrend, taking every opportunity to sell because they believe that the base
                                            currency would go down even more.

                                        <p>If a currency pair does not go much higher or much lower, we can say that it is
                                            going sideways. When this happens the prices are moving within a narrow range,
                                            and are neither appreciating nor depreciating much in value. If you want to ride on
                                            a trend, this directionless mode is one that you do not wish to be stuck in, for it is
                                            very likely to have a net loss position in a sideways market especially if the trade
                                            has not made enough pips to cover the spread commission costs.
                                            For the Trend Riding Strategy, I shall focus only on the uptrend and the downtrend.

                                        <h3>Stages of a Trend</h3>
                                        <p>A trend has a start point and an end point; in between these two points, the trend
                                            can exhibit different behaviours. As a trend rider, it is important to note the various
                                            stages of a trend so that you don’t get on the trend train at the last stage, just when
                                            smart people are starting to disembark from it. The stages of a trend are not clearcut,
                                            and that includes the starting and ending stages; and each stage can vary in
                                            length of time.

                                            you can see, Stage 1 of the uptrend started when the currency pair first
                                            emerged from the down trendline. The uptrend was confirmed at Stage 2,
                                            when NZD/USD began making higher highs and higher lows – typically
                                            characteristic of an uptrend. Later, a double top formation hinted that the
                                            uptrend was at Stage 3 when the trend was beginning to show signs of
                                            weariness. NZD/USD then made one last attempt to make a new high which
                                            failed to attract any sustained buying interest, thus paving the way for Stage
                                            4, which signalled the end of the uptrend.

                                        <h1>Nascent trend</h1>
                                        <p>Right after a reversal, the embryonic trend emerges into the new territory with the
                                            greatest amount of uncertainty, as traders have the least amount of confidence in the
                                            direction of the nascent trend. Price moves are often sharp, and may even retest the
                                            price levels seen before the entry into the new territory as bulls and bears wrestle for
                                            power. This characterises Stage 1 of a trend, and it is where aggressive traders get
                                            into the currency market, hoping to be right about the new direction of the trend and
                                            reap potentially the most profits by getting in early. Since this stage of the trend has
                                            the greatest level of uncertainty, it is also where the risk of trend failure is greatest.
                                        </p>
                                        <h1>Fully charged trend</h1>
                                        <p>By the time the trend reaches Stage 2, it is fully charged. Either the bulls or the
                                            bears have won the battle over the other by now, and are persistently pushing the
                                            currency prices higher during an uptrend, or lower during a downtrend. The highly
                                            confident behaviour of the bulls in the uptrend and of the bears in the downtrend
                                            gives little room for uncertainty about the trend direction. This stage is ideally the
                                            best time for the risk-averse trader to join in the prevailing trend, after getting
                                            confirmation from the technical picture and market sentiment.
                                        </p>
                                        <h1>Aging trend</h1>
                                        <p>As with human beings, a trend gets old and tired eventually. Aging of a trend
                                            typically occurs in Stage 3, and it is at this stage that you can witness the fallacies
                                            of man. Overly eager traders, especially those who have missed out on the initial
                                            stages of the trend, are now realising their tardiness, and are hopping onto the trend
                                            bandwagon, hoping to still be able to get a piece of the action. The more experienced
                                            traders are more than happy to pass on the closing legs of their transactions over to
                                            these inexperienced traders as they try to take their profits while the trend is near the
                                            peak of an uptrend, or near the bottom of a downtrend. Seasoned traders begin to
                                            lose their confidence in the strength of the trend, whereas inexperienced traders who
                                            are still hoping to gain more profits remain optimistic about the trend. So there is a
                                            mix of waning confidence and overconfidence in the trend at this stage. More price consolidation periods could be seen at this stage, and chart patterns like head-andshoulders
                                            or double top/bottom are commonly found here.
                                        </p>
                                        <h1>End of trend</h1>
                                        <p>The last stage is when the trend begins to crumble and lose its staying power. In an
                                            uptrend, shortage of bullish newcomers halts the advance of higher prices, and
                                            some begin to take their profits, pushing the prices lower and lower. In a
                                            downtrend, a lack of new bears coming into the market stops the currency prices
                                            from going lower, and when they start to take profits, prices start going up. The
                                            crumbling and ending of a trend can come fast and furiously, without much warning
                                            to traders, or it can be a more prolonged process as power changes hands between
                                            the bulls and bears. Usually a trend reversal is brought about by a major change in
                                            the underlying sentiment about a currency. Jumping onto this stage of a trend in
                                            order to ride the underlying trend can be very risky as the trend is close to ending,
                                            and there is a high chance of the trade getting stopped out.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The most profitable entry points into a trend are at Stages 1 and 2, where the
                                            potential for the trend to grow and continue is great. Profit potential at Stage 3 may
                                            be limited as the trend has matured, and it is where most profit-taking takes place.
                                            When it comes to riding a trend, potential for loss becomes huge when getting in at
                                            Stage 4.
