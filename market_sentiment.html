                        <h3>What Is Market Sentiment?</h3>
                        <a href="https://grbounty.link/resources/hit/1262/egqcqfRWtj"><img src="https://grbounty.link/resources/view/1262/egqcqfRWtj" alt="Tools to sell knowledge online"/></a>
                        <p>Market sentiment is simply what the majority of the market is perceived to be
                            thinking or feeling about the market – it is the most important factor that drives the
                            currency market.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is so because traders tend to act based on what they feel and think of certain
                            currencies, regarding their strength or weakness relative to other currencies. I will
                            assume that when you trade currencies, you don’t blindfold yourself to simply pick
                            any pair to buy or sell, leaving it to randomness to determine your profit/loss
                            statement at the end of the day or month.
                        </p>
                        <p>Market sentiment sums up the overall dominating emotion of the majority of the
                            market participants, and explains the current actions of the market, as well as the
                            future course of actions of the market. The trend adopted by the forex market is
                            actually a reflection of the current market sentiment, which in turn guides the
                            trading decisions of other traders, whether they should long or short a currency pair.
                            In the process of making educated trading decisions, traders have to weigh a
                            multitude of factors which could influence the bias of a currency, before making up
                            their minds about the current and future state of certain currencies. One thing to
                            note is that market sentiment is not logical; it is primarily based on traders’
                            emotions, which is really one of the greatest, if not the greatest, factor in the
                            determination of a currency exchange rate. <br>
                            There are three main types of sentiment when it comes to forming opinions in the
                            forex market:
                        </p>
                        <p>1. bullish,</p>
                        <p>2. bearish or</p>
                        <p>3. just plain confused.</p>
                        <p>If the majority of the market wants to sell that currency, the market sentiment is
                            deemed to be bearish; if the majority wants to buy that currency, the market
                            sentiment is bullish; and when most market participants are unsure of what to do at
                            the moment, the sentiment ends up being mixed. Since the US dollar is the currency
                            on the opposite side of 80% of all foreign exchange transactions, most traders will
                            be concerned with what the market thinks about the US dollar. Currency prices
                            simply embody the market’s perceptions of reality and the sum total of
                            traders’ emotions.
                        </p>

                            <p>Market sentiment acts like a fickle lover, capable of changing its mind based on
                                certain incoming new information which can upset the existing sentiment. One
                                moment everyone could be buying the US dollar in anticipation of a stronger dollar;
                                the next second they could all be dumping it as they fear the dollar would start to
                                weaken due to the impact of some new piece of information, which is almost
                                always some fundamental news.
                            </p>
                            <p>Understanding the current market sentiment and exploiting it appropriately with the
                                other strategies discussed in this book can help maximise your trading profits,
                                because if you can guess what the other market players are thinking about, and
                                understand why the market is doing what it is doing, you will be in a better position
                                to plan your entry and exit points and timing.

                            <h3><a id="Interest"></a>INTEREST RATES</h3>
                            <p>Trends in interest rates are one of the most significant factors influencing market
                                sentiment, as interest rates play a huge role affecting the supply and demand
                                of currencies.
                            </p>
                            <p>Every currency in the world has interest rates attached to them, and these rates are
                                decided by central banks. For example, the Fed in the US determines the country’s
                                interest rates; the Bank of Japan (BOJ) sets Japan’s interest rates; the Reserve Bank
                                of New Zealand (RBNZ) decides on New Zealand’s interest rates and so on. Some
                                currencies have higher interest rates than others, and these are usually the
                                currencies that attract the most attention from savvy international investors who are
                                always looking across the global landscape in the continual search for a better
                                interest rate yield on fixed-income investments. This, of course, also depends on the
                                geopolitical or economic risks of that particular currency. Just like when a bank
                                lends money to a higher-risk borrower, high-risk currencies require a significantly
                                higher interest rate for investors to consider keeping money in those currencies.
                            </p>
                            <h1>What causes fluctuations in interest rates?</h1>
                            <p>The value of money can and does decrease when there is an upward revision of
                                prices of most goods and services in a country. Generally, when a country’s
                                economy expands or when energy costs go up, goods ranging from clothing, food
                                to computers, and services ranging from public transport to spa treatments get more
                                expensive, thus eroding the value of money. The nice word for this erosion in value
                                is, of course, inflation.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Controlling inflation</h1>
                            <p>Central banks are responsible for ensuring price stability in their own country, and
                                one of the ways they employ to fight inflationary pressures is through the setting of
                                interest rates. If inflation risks are seen to be edging upward in, say, the US, the Fed
                                would raise the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which banks charge each
                                other for overnight loans. When the overnight rate is changed, retail banks will
                                change their prime lending rates accordingly, hence affecting businesses and
                                individuals. An increase in interest rates is an attempt to make money more
                                expensive to borrow so that there will be a gradual decrease in demand for that
                                currency, thus slowing down an overheated economy. The opposite scenario is true
                                too: when a country faces deflation, or even decreased inflation, which is often the
                                result of decreased spending, whether by the government, consumers or investors,
                                it prompts the central bank to lower interest rates so as to stimulate spending.
                            </p>

                            <h1>Interest rates and currencies</h1>
                            <p>The most important way in which interest rates can influence currency prices is
                                through the widespread practice of the carry trade.
                                A carry trade involves the borrowing and subsequent selling of a certain currency
                                with a relatively low interest rate, then using the funds to buy a currency which
                                gives a higher interest rate, in an attempt to gain the difference between these two
                                rates – which is known as the interest rate differential. The trader is paid interest
                                on the currency he or she is long in, and must pay interest on the currency he or she
                                is shorting. This difference is the cost of carry. Therefore, a currency with a higher
                                interest rate tends to be highly sought after by investors looking for a higher return
                                on their investments.
                            </p>
                            <p>Rising interest rates in a country tends to strengthen that country’s currency relative
                                to other currencies as investors exchange other currencies to buy the currency of
                                that country when they transfer their assets into the country with the higher interest
                                rates. The increased demand for that particular currency will thus push up the
                                currency price against other currencies.
                                For instance, in 2005 there was a strong interest among Japanese investors to invest
                                in New Zealand dollar-denominated assets due to rising interest rates in New
                                Zealand. The then near-zero interest rates in Japan forced a lot of Japanese
                                investors to look outside of their country for better yields on cash deposits or fixedincome
                                instruments.
                            </p>

                            <p>When forex traders anticipate this kind of situation, they become more inclined to
                                buy that high-interest-rate currency as well, knowing that there is likely to be
                                massive buying interest for that currency.

                            <h3><a id="Economic"></a>ECONOMIC GROWTH</h3>
                            <p>Besides interest rates, economic growth of countries can also have a big impact on
                                the overall currency market sentiment.
                            </p>
                            <p>Since the United States has the largest economy in the world, the US economy is a
                                key factor in determining the overall market sentiment, especially of currency pairs
                                that have the USD component. A robust economic expansion, coupled with a
                                healthy labour market, tends to boost consumer spending in that country, and this
                                helps companies and businesses to flourish. A country with a strong economy is in
                                a better position to attract more overseas investments into the country, as investors
                                generally prefer to invest in a solid economy that is growing at a steady pace.
                            </p>
                            <p>Investments pouring into a country requires the currency of that country to be
                                bought in exchange of other currencies; this increased demand for that country’s
                                currency should cause that currency to strengthen against other currencies. Forex
                                traders, expecting this consequence, will put on their bullish cap to buy that
                                currency before the investors do.
                            </p>
                            <p>Some of the most important indicators of a country’s economic growth include: <br>
                                1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), <br>
                                2. the unemployment rate, and <br>
                                3. trade balance data.
                            </p>
                            <h1>1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h1>
                            <p>The GDP measures the total value of all goods and services that are originated from
                                the country; the GDP figure indicates the rate of the country’s expansion or
                                contraction based on output and growth. A healthy GDP figure usually adds bullish
                                sentiment to the currency of that country, especially if it exceeds the market’s
                                expectations.
                            </p>
                            <h1>Unemployment rate</h1>
                            <p>The unemployment data reports the state of the labour market of a country. The
                                lower the unemployment rate, the more positive it is for the country’s economy, and
                                hence its currency, as consumers would feel more confident about spending if they
                                have jobs, and that would eventually impact on companies and businesses in the
                                country, generating more output.
                            </p>
                            <h1>trade balance data</h1>
                            <p>Another widely watched economic indicator is the trade balance data. Trade
                                balance measures the difference between the value of imports and exports of goods
                                and services of a country. If a country exports more than it imports, it has a trade
                                surplus. If imports exceed exports, then the country will end up with a trade deficit,
                                which does not bode well for that country’s currency because that currency has to
                                be sold to buy other foreign currencies in order to pay for those imported goods and
                                services.
                            </p>
                            <p>For example, if the US imports an increased amount of goods and services from
                                Europe, US dollars will have to be sold in exchange to buy euros to pay for those
                                imports. The resulting outflow of US dollars from the United States could
                                potentially cause a depreciation of the US dollar against the euro or other
                                currencies, and that can affect market sentiment surrounding the USD. The
                                opposite scenario is true for a country that is experiencing a trade surplus. However,
                                market sentiment of a currency can still be bullish despite that country having a
                                trade deficit, as the net amount of trade deficit could be covered by an equivalent
                                or greater amount of capital investment pouring into that country, and thus would
                                not be a cause for concern.
                            </p>

                            <p>Geopolitical risk refers to the risk of a country’s foreign or domestic policy
                                affecting domestic social and political stability in another country or regional zone.
                                Global geopolitical uncertainties such as terrorism, transitional change of
                                government or nuclear threats can cause investors to lose faith in some particular
                                currencies, and they may prefer to shift their assets into a safe haven currency when
                                these circumstances arise. Market sentiment is very sensitive to such geopolitical
                                developments, and can cause a strong bias towards a particular currency.
                            </p>
                            <p>For example, during periods of high tension in the Middle East in 2006, the market
                                formed a very bullish sentiment towards the US dollar, which became the preferred
                                currency to hold in such turbulent times, replacing the traditional status of the
                                Swiss franc as the safe haven currency. Forex traders should be keenly aware of the
                                current geopolitical environment in order to keep track of any potential change in
                                market sentiment, which could impact currency prices.

                                                the current market situation. But how can you get an idea of the overall sentiment
                                                of the market? You can do so by reading reports by analysts and financial
                                                journalists in news wires or by visiting online trading forums to see what other
                                                traders are discussing. However, these ways of getting a feel of the current market
                                                sentiment are not too accurate; you may think that other traders are in a buying or
                                                selling mood, but that may not be what is really happening in reality. Here are some
                                                of the more effective ways of gauging market sentiment:
                                            </p>
                                            <p>1. The Commitment of Traders (COT) report <br>
                                                2. The market’s reactions to news releases <br>
                                                These are explained in more details below.
                                            </p>
                                            <h1>Commitment Of Traders (COT) report</h1>
                                            <h1>What is the COT?</h1>
                                            <p>The COT report provides traders with detailed positioning information about the
                                                futures market, and is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated tools that forex
                                                traders can make use of to enhance their trading performance.
                                                The report is compiled and released weekly by the Commodity Futures Trading
                                                Commission (CFTC) in the United States every Friday at 15:30 Eastern Time, and
                                                records open interest information about the futures market based on the previous
                                                Tuesday. Anyone can access the COT report for free on the <a href="www.cftc.gov/cftc/cftccotreports.htm">CFTC website</a>.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>There are basically two types of reports available: the futures-only COT report and
                                                the futures-and-options-combined COT report. I usually just access the futuresonly
                                                report for a glimpse of what has happened in the futures dimension of the
                                                forex market. In order to get through to the currency futures data, you have to wade
                                                past other commodities like milk, feeder cattle and so on, so a little patience is
                                                required.
                                                Even though the data arrives three days late, the information nonetheless can be
                                                helpful since many traders spend their weekend analyzing the COT report. The time
                                                lag between reporting and release is the main handicap of the COT data, but despite
                                                this limitation, you can still use it as a sentiment tool.
                                            </p>

                                            <h1>Market’s reactions to news</h1>
                                            <p>Another way for traders to gauge the market sentiment is by analyzing how the
                                                market responds to unanticipated news.
                                                The forex market is very efficient at discounting future expectations by
                                                incorporating them into current prices. Very often, when news comes out better
                                                than is expected by economists and analysts, the currency of that country is more
                                                likely to soar against another currency. When the news is worse than expected, that
                                                currency is more likely to fall against another currency.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>However, if the news or data turn out to be worse than expected and still the
                                                currency price soars, that is, the market reacts in a very bullish way to worse than
                                                expected data, a bright red flag should be waving at you. The opposite situation also
                                                applies: if price action remains very bearish to much better than expected news, it
                                                signals a highly suspect price move.
                                                In short, you should look out for a contrarian market reaction to better or worse than
                                                expected news. Under these circumstances, it is better to assume that the price
                                                move is hardly supported by substance, and could reverse sometime soon.Abullish
                                                price move that is not accompanied by evidence will soon be due for a reality
                                                check, just like a bearish price move that is not accompanied by evidence is very
                                                likely to be corrected very soon. If you day trade the forex market, you may judge
                                                the market’s reaction based on one piece of news, but if you position trade, monitor
                                                the market’s reactions to several news to see if the responses are still contrary.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>For example, if a piece of news turns out to be worse than expected, and assuming
                                                that there are no pre-release rumours or leaks of the news, and the currency pair
                                                rallies to break above a significant resistance level, you have reasons to suspect that
                                                the breakout move is likely to be false and unsustainable. Even if the currency pair
                                                manages to make new highs later on, you should be prepared for a possible trend
                                                reversal very soon. Monitoring the market’s reactions to news can enable traders to
                                                identify corrective moves in the forex market.

                                            <p>Not all news items get the same amount of attention from big market players; news
                                                relating to the job or housing market usually get more attention. The relative
                                                significance of news will vary from time to time.
