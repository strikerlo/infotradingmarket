        <h2>OPENING OF A FOREX TRADING ACCOUNT</h2>
        <h3>How do I set up an account?</h3>
        <p id="indent">Before you set up a trading account to trade forex, you first need to choose which forex
            broker best suits your needs and trading style. There are mainly two types of brokers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>ECN (Electronic Communication Network)</li>
            <li>Market-Maker</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="indent">It is very important to make sure that the broker is situated in a country where
            their activities can be monitored by a regulatory agency.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Experiment first with virtual money</h3>
        <p id="indent">The best way to learn how to trade forex and to see if it is suitable for you is to trade
            it real-time, but with a demo account initially. Demo accounts can be opened for
            free with certain brokers; no real money is deposited in this type of account. You
            can experiment real-time trading with different currency pairs using various trading
            strategies without losing any real money – it is a good way to build up some
            confidence. You can get a sense of how it feels to have a profit or a loss, even
            though the intensity of these emotions will be of a different level when trading with
            real money. It is the best way for new traders to dip their toes in the water.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>How much money is needed to start?</h3>
        <p id="indent">The amount of trading capital needed is relative. After getting a feel with a demo
            account, you can start with real money. The first type of account you can open is a
            mini account which requires a minimum of just a few hundred US dollars (some
            brokers even allow you to open a mini account with just US$100). However, don’t
            expect to grow rich on such a small amount. For standard-sized accounts, the
            general minimum is around a few thousand US dollars.</p>
           <center><i style="text-align: center; font-weight: bolder;">Thinking of putting your life savings into a trading account?</i></center> 
        <p id="indent">Don’t. Only trade with money you can afford to lose. Make sure that even if you
            lose all of your trading capital, your lifestyle won’t be affected.</p>
        <p id="indent">If you lose a large amount, you may never want to trade again. Whereas if you lose
            virtual money in a demo account, or a small amount in a mini account, it may be
            easier to pick yourself back up after losses – both emotionally and financially.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>How to Choose a Broker</h3>
            <p id="indent">The forex broker that you use can significantly affect your trading success.</p>
            <p id="indent">There are two types of forex brokers: market makers and ECNs. But in practice
                things are not so clear-cut – there are market makers out there who falsely market
                themselves as not having dealing desks, while there are also some brokers who
                claim to be true ECNs when they are not.</p>
            <p id="indent">The choice of broker must be an individual decision, because everyone has
                different needs and preferences. Both new and existing traders should carefully
                examine the practices and policy contracts of brokers, and be up-to-date with new
                information on brokers.</p>
            <p id="indent">Below are some points that you might want to consider when selecting a broker.
                You can use it as a rough guide to narrow down some candidates that match your
                own needs.</p>
            <h3>Broker type</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Do you prefer to trade with a market maker or an ECN?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How safe are your funds with them?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Broker location</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Is the broker regulated by any regulatory authority in that country? [Refer to the
                    appendix for a list of main regulatory organisations.] Note that even if the broker
                    is regulated, no entity can completely guarantee the safety of client funds.</li>
                <li>Are the client funds insured against fraud, theft, or embezzlement?</li>
                <li>Are the funds maintained separately from the broker’s operating funds? Even if
                    the broker says that the funds are kept separate, it does not mean that they are
                    segregated as defined according to certain agencies’ regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Trial account</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Does the broker provide a trial demo account?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Trading platform</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How many different currency pairs can you trade?</li>
                <li>Does it come with any charting interface? Can you trade from the charts?</li>
                <li>Are you comfortable with the order placing system?</li>
                <li>Do they have one-click trading? This will be useful when scalping.</li>
                <li>Is order execution instant and efficient? This will be especially crucial if you
                    are scalping.</li>
                <li>Does it freeze during times of news releases or when the market is moving
                    very fast?</li>
                <li>If you want to implement your own automated trading system, does it offer an
                    Application Programming Interface (API)?</li>
                <li>Will you need to trade while on the move? If so, check if it has a mobile or webbased
                    version that you can use for trading.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Account and trade size</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the minimum amount that is required for opening an account?</li>
                <li>What is the minimum trade size? 10,000 or 100,000 currency units?</li>
                <li>Can you make adjustments to the lot size traded?</li>
                <li>What is the maximum size you can trade without having to call for a quote?</li>
                <li>What is the maximum size they will guarantee your orders be filled at? Or, if it
                    is an ECN, how easy is it to fill big orders?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Order types and handling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What order types are supported? Do they support Stop, Limit, Stop-Limit, One-
                    Triggers-Other (OTO) and One-Cancels-Other (OCO) orders?</li>
                <li>How much slippage do you get when trading during news releases?</li>
                <li>Find out the broker’s policy on stop-loss and limit orders. Depending on the
                    policy, it is possible to end up with closing prices that are worse than expected.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Commissions and spreads</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>ECNs generally charge a commission when you open and close your positions.
                    Are you willing to accept that?</li>
                <li>Are spreads fixed or variable?</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="indent">If spreads are variable, how wide do they get during important news releases?</p>
            <h3>Margin</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the margin percentage? The lower the margin required, the greater the
                    amount of leverage.</li>
                <li>Is the margin requirement identical for mini and standard accounts?</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="indent">Once you have narrowed the broker list down to a few candidates, be sure to read
                the terms and conditions of the respective contracts, and understand what you are
                in for before you sign anything. Later on when you have graduated to an
                intermediate or advanced phase in trading forex, you may then choose to spread
                your money among a few brokers so as to reduce exposure to a single broker.</p>
