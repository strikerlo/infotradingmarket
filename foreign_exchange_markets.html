                        <p>The global forex market, being the world’s most liquid financial market, offers many exciting <a href="http://info-tradingmarket.com">opportunities for traders</a> to profit from exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
                            <p>Forex (or FX) refers to the <a href="http://info-tradingmarket.com/foreign_exchange_markets">foreign exchange markets</a>, where currencies are traded.
                            It is the biggest and fastest growing financial market in the world, with an average
                            daily turnover of almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_spot">$2 trillion</a> – many times the total traded volume of the US
                            stock exchanges.</p>
                            <p>The forex market consists of a worldwide wired network of buyers and sellers of
                                currencies, with trading all done <a href="">over-the-counter (OTC)</a>, which means that there
                                is no central exchange and clearinghouse where orders are matched. If you are
                                looking for 24-hour action, you can find it in this global trading system, where no
                                physical barriers exist and activity moves seamlessly from one major financial
                                centre to another.

                                <p>A reason why there is a veil of mystery over forex is that the market was once the

                                    where money changed hands for commercial and speculative purposes. However,
                                    forex has now expanded and is easily accessible to all traders with the rapid

                                        and sell currencies through an internet connection with a click of the mouse,
                                        dealing with invisible counter-parties on the other side of the transaction. This

                                        <p>The rapid fluctuations of currency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate">exchange rates</a> are what attract speculators to the
                                            forex market as currencies are highly sensitive, and thus react very fast to changing
                                            economic conditions of countries or regions, changing interest rates and political
                                            happenings around the world. Sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank">central banks</a> of countries attempt to
                                            intervene in the forex market if the policy-makers feel that their country’s currency
                                            is too strong or too weak for their own good. All these factors lead to high volatility
                                            of currency prices, which can be taken advantage of by traders who speculate on
                                            the direction and magnitude of the current and future price move.</p>
                                            <p>I would like to point out that while movements in certain currency pairs can be
                                                quite volatile in nature, most major currencies generally move less than 1% daily,
                                                which is much lower than that of active stocks, which can easily move between 5-
                                                10% per day. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Forex has increasingly become an extremely attractive alternative asset group for
                                                speculators to trade, in addition to the usual staple of stocks and futures. Anyone can trade forex, but not every one can be profitable. That’s the rule of any
                                                game – not every one can win.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>Before you set up a trading account to trade forex, you first need to choose which forex
                                                broker best suits your needs and trading style. There are mainly two types of brokers:

                                            <p>It is very important to make sure that the broker is situated in a country where

                                            <p>The best way to learn how to trade forex and to see if it is suitable for you is to trade
                                                it real-time, but with a demo account initially. Demo accounts can be opened for
                                                free with certain brokers; no real money is deposited in this type of account. You
                                                can experiment real-time trading with different currency pairs using various trading
                                                strategies without losing any real money – it is a good way to build up some
                                                confidence. You can get a sense of how it feels to have a profit or a loss, even
                                                though the intensity of these emotions will be of a different level when trading with
                                                real money. It is the best way for new traders to dip their toes in the water.

                                            <h3>How much money is needed to start?</h3>
                                            <p>The amount of trading capital needed is relative. After getting a feel with a demo
                                                account, you can start with real money. The first type of account you can open is a
                                                mini account which requires a minimum of just a few hundred US dollars (some
                                                brokers even allow you to open a mini account with just US$100). However, don’t
                                                expect to grow rich on such a small amount. For standard-sized accounts, the
                                                general minimum is around a few thousand US dollars.</p>

                                            <p>Don’t. Only trade with money you can afford to lose. Make sure that even if you
                                                lose all of your trading capital, your lifestyle won’t be affected.</p>
                                            <p>If you lose a large amount, you may never want to trade again. Whereas if you lose
                                                virtual money in a demo account, or a small amount in a mini account, it may be
                                                easier to pick yourself back up after losses – both emotionally and financially.
                                            </p>

                                                <p id="indent">There are two types of forex brokers: market makers and ECNs. But in practice
                                                    things are not so clear-cut – there are market makers out there who falsely market
                                                    themselves as not having dealing desks, while there are also some brokers who
                                                    claim to be true ECNs when they are not.</p>
                                                <p id="indent">The choice of broker must be an individual decision, because everyone has
                                                    different needs and preferences. Both new and existing traders should carefully
                                                    examine the practices and policy contracts of brokers, and be up-to-date with new
